It’s been a long and rewarding journey of learning and adapting, so I wanted to summarize a few of the top lessons learned, give thanks, and look forward.\nFigure 1: Source: The Economist and Lucy Ding Final Remarks I’ve learned a lot this semester, and much of it has been through guided trial-and-error. Looking back, I feel very proud of all the work I’ve done, and how accurate my models were, especially given that they were my first real shots at forecasting U.S. elections. Looking forward to the predictive challenges to come in 2024, and generally, what else data science can tell us about government and people.\nLessons Learned Good data is pretty hard to come by, still. For me, some of the best resources so far have came from the GOV 1347 teaching team, FiveThirtyEight, PewResearch, Dave Leip, and Wikipedia. Build out national seat share and national vote share models separately. When switching out independent variables, consider different combinations of dependent ones, even if the independent variables are closely related.\nFundamentals (incumbency, past electoral history, the economy) are highly, highly predictive for district-level models. This is especially important in relation to lesson #1, since there’s generally more historical fundamentals data available than campaign or dynamics data. Incorporate more creative predictors. Drawing directly or indirectly from the literature, don’t be afraid to create new variables that may be predictive. For example, in House races, try an indicator variable for a Senate or gubernatorial race on the ballot. In any race, test Vavreck’s campaign messaging theory by incorporating a variable that speaks to the campaign’s success at conveying an insurgent or clarifying message. Stay open minded and adaptive. As a great professor once told me, social science is hard. Elections are, in many ways, predictable. But it’s very, very difficult to get it right on the nose, with all the forces and factors in the world influencing how people think and vote. Additionally, the elections we try to forecast only happen once every two or four years, so not only is data scarce, but so are trials. There will always be new predictors to consider, like The Economist’s suggestion of special election performance or a newly popular insurgent campaign issue like abortion, so keep an eye out, try new methods and predictors, and stay committed to good science (confidence intervals, probabilistic forecasting). Thank Yous I want to thank Professor Ryan Enos and Teaching Fellows Kiara Hernandez and Yao Yu for their compassion and patience, hard work providing us with data for analysis, and most importantly, delivery of the tools and knowledge we needed to learn the science, and art, of election analytics. From paired discussions to technical labs to the coolest guest speakers, every learning opportunity has been appreciated.\nThank you to all of my classmates in GOV 1347: Election Analytics, who came from many different academic backgrounds, for their insights and support as we’ve built out our models together.\nIt’s been a genuine pleasure learning from you all.\nOnto the Next! As of December 7, 2022, I plan to commit to this forecasting journey all over again for the 2024 elections. The presidency, all 435 House seats, and 34 Senate seats will be up for grabs, and I hope to go bigger and better, with (probabilistic) forecasts for all, or most, of them. I will also have freshly graduated Harvard College by then, so it will really be an interesting time.\nHopefully, talk to again you then!\nBest wishes,\nVivian\n","date":"8 December 2022","permalink":"/personal/posts/2022-12-07-2022-final-remarks/","section":"Posts","summary":"The Plan Today I couldn’t end this series without saying a few final remarks, so here we are!

This week, I will take a deep dive into Washington’s 8th congressional district to carefully analyze how its House race went after a brief review of the general characteristics of the district (including geography, demographics, candidates, electoral history) and its forecasted outcome per my models and those of the experts. I will then evaluate the forecasts’ accuracies and the race’s actual outcome, commenting on the campaigns ran and how they may have contributed to the outcome deviations from the forecasts.\nWashington’s 8th Congressional District Figure 1: Source: CNN. Fast Facts Directly east of Seattle and Tacoma (where I was born!), Washington’s 8th congressional district is located in western Washington, covering most of King, Pierce, Chelan, Douglas, Snohomish, and Kittitas Counties. The region has a Mediterranean climate, with mild summers and moist winters (Choose Washington). Its geography is defined by the Cascade Mountain range, being home of the Mt. Baker National Forest, Wenatchee National Forest, Wenatchee Mountains, and part of the Mount Rainier National Park.\nAs of the 2021 American Community Survey, WA-8 has a population of over 780,000 and is home to 284,410 households. The median age is 39.2, slightly higher than the U.S. median of 38.8. The sex ratio is 49:51 female:male. The average income is $50,047 and the median household income is $103,625, both considerably higher than the U.S. average and median of $38,332 and $69,717. This aligns with the heightened educational attainment of the district, with 92.7% of the population being high school graduates or higher and 39% holding bachelor’s degrees or higher (compared to the U.S. averages of 89.4% and 35%) (Census Reporter). As of 2020, the district is 68.5% white, 9.6% Asian, 5.3% multiracial (non-Hispanic), 5% other (Hispanic), 4.8% white (Hispanic), 3% African American, 1.6% multiracial (Hispanic), 1% Native Hawaiian and PI, and 1% American Indian and Alaska Native (Data USA).\nWA-8 was created in the post-1980-Census redistricting cycle. Until 2003, it was mostly comprised of King and Pierce Counties. Between 2003 and 2013, the district was grew larger with the addition of Samarnish County. From 2013 until 2020, the district grew even larger with Chelan and Kittatas being added. CNN tracked the most recent changes after the 2020 redistricting cycle, shown below.\nFigure 2: Source: CNN. Up until 2018, the district was a Republican stronghold for the House despite consistently electing a Democratic nominee for presidency since 1992 (Ballotpedia). In 2018, Kim Schrier (D) became the first Democrat to represent WA-8 after winning the race for the newly open seat against Republican Dino Rossi. Today, the district is described as “Washington’s swingiest congressional district” (Seattle Times).\n2022 Campaigns For the 2022 midterms, WA-8 saw two major campaigns from Democratic incumbent Kim Schrier and Republican challenger Matt Larkin.\nFigure 3: Source: New York Times Background and Key Issues Prior to serving in the House of Representatives, Kim Schrier, M.D., graduated from U.C. Berkeley with a degree in Astrophysics and had a successful career as a pediatrician in the Puget Sound region (House site and campaign site). For her 2022 re-election bid, she emphasized her efforts to increase affordable, quality healthcare, to protect women’s rights, and to build a “middle-class centered economy.” Whilst labeling herself a “pragmatic centrist” and emphasizing her ability to work with both parties, Schrier champions women’s rights to abortion and reproductive care, as well as clean energy policies (Seattle Times).\nMatt Larkin, J.D., is a Washington native, with a deep family history of 165+ years in the state. He graduated from Westmont College, and is a licensed attorney in both Washington and Oregon. After briefly serving in the White House as a speechwriter for President George W. Bush, he returned to Washington to his family manufacturing business (campaign site). His 2022 campaign featured a central message of “Make crime illegal again”, calling attention to Washington’s rising crime with a nod to President Trump’s infamous “Make America Great Again” presidential slogan. In his submitted biography to Ballotpedia, he also highlights the rising inflation in the U.S. and his plan “to reign in federal spending, fix our supply chains, get wages rising again, and restore prosperity for everyday Americans.” The last of his 3 key messages is that he is the right candidate for the everyday Washingtonian - he is a not a career politican, but rather, an active community member endorsed by healthcare workers, law enforcement groups, and local officeholders.\nThe Air War As a well-funded incumbent - $8,551,740 versus Larkin’s $2,141,608 of raised funds -, Schrier enjoyed a large airwaves advantage. According to the Wesleyan Media Project, the pro-Democrat airings totaled 11,431 in comparison to the pro-Republican count of 6,190 from September 5 through October 30, 2022. This Democrat advantage is only second to that of VA-02.\nOne advertisement that landed Schrier in a bit of controversy was an attacking one that proclaimed Larkin was dangerous, intending to cut Veterans’ healthcare and support a national ban on abortion (see ad here). The Washington Veterans Vote PAC, an endorser of Larkin, soon posted to its Facebook page that the ad was deceitful and maintains that “Matt is dedicated to ensuring all Veterans receive the medical support they need and the well-earned benefits they deserve. This ad clearly shows Kim Schrier lacks the integrity to represent our veterans or our country at the national level.” An astute commentator remarks, “Every republican is promising to reverse inflation by cutting spending…just not the spending the people they are pandering to want….. increased spending for veterans is Part of that out of control spending he keeps promising to cut”.\nA whopping $7,346,778 was spent by outside groups to oppose Larkin (Open Secrets), and one example of this spending is this ad paid for by the pro-environment League of Conservation Voters. The ad categorizes Larkin as an extremist-sympathizer, strong supporter of Donald Trump, and anti-abortion candidate.\nAs for Larkin, he kept true to his central slogan of “Make crime illegal again,” making crime the central theme of this attacking ad.\nIn a summer interview with conservative radio host Jason Rantz, Larkin described his stance on climate issues as non-urgent, responding to President Biden’s earlier speech on climate change in Somerset, MA that emphasized that the latest climate report is a “code red for humanity.” Instead, Larkin affirms that inflation is a more pressing issue than climate change for voters, as “people are hurting… they can’t fill their gas tanks, they can’t afford groceries, they don’t feel safe going into their local park.”\nAccording to a post-debate report by KUOW, “Puget Sound’s #1 radio station for news”, despite Larkin’s reiterated beliefs in federal spending cuts and strong pro-life stance, he did not specify where the cuts would occur or whether or not he supports any specific exceptions should there be a federal abortion ban. Schrier declined to comment on the limits of abortion rights herself. Ultimately, the article labeled the candidates’ responses in the October 28th debate as evasive.\nForecasts As of November 7, 2022, The Cook Political Report called WA-8 a Democrat Toss Up. Despite that competitive rating, polls were scarce in the district, with RMG Research’s mid-August poll being the most recent and only one; it reported 47% support for Schrier and 43% for Larkin, with a sample of 400 likely voters and 4.9% margin of error.\nFiveThirtyEight predicted that Schrier wins 72 out of 100 simulated races, with an average two-party popular vote share of 51.2%. The Economist was a little more optimistic for Schrier, giving her a 81% chance of winning, with 53.3% of the two-party vote share. As for my own models, the competitive one (which considered incumbency and pollster ratings) predicted that Schrier would win 47.24% of the vote share, and the non-competitive one (which considered incumbency and previous Democrat vote share) predicted that she would win 51.5% of the vote share. In the latter, my confidence interval was very wide for WA-8 in comparison to other WA districts, at (37.01, 66.01).\nOutcome In actuality, Schrier won 53.4% of the two-party vote with 179,003 of the 334,979 total votes (New York Times). Larkin finished with 46.6% of the vote share and 155,976 raw votes. The majority of the Democratic support came from King County, where Schrier led by 24 points. In contrast, Larkin led in all 5 other counties, whose total votes (152,542) were outnumbered by King County’s (182,437) alone.\nThe Cook Political Report was perhaps overly conservative in rating the race as a Democrat Toss Up rather than Lean or Likely. The early polls gave us an understated evaluation of the Democrat win margin, which ended up being 6.8 percentage points rather than 4. My competitive model underpredicted Schrier’s vote share by 6.16 percentage points, which I will investigate further below. Both FiveThirtyEight and my non-competitive model predicted vote-shares for Schrier 2 percentage points shy of the true value. Though of course, FiveThirtyEight and The Economist were considerably confident that Schrier would secure the seat with their probablistic forecasts. The Economist came remarkably close to reality with their vote-share prediction, missing the mark by only 0.1 percentage point.\nThe Interaction of Campaigns, Candidates, and Outcome While all of the aforementioned forecasts, with the exception of that of my competitive district model, were able to call the winner of the WA-8 race, the forecasts varied widely by magnitude of vote-share accuracy. I will reflect on these variations below, drawing on literature and what I’ve learned in GOV 1347 to speculate on how the WA-8 campaigns and candidates may have contributed to the district’s deviation from the predicted outcomes.\nAs the 2022 midterms drew near and I built out my own models, I considered both FiveThirtyEight’s and The Economist’s methodologies. In week 3, I noted that The Economist relies more on generic ballot polling data, while FiveThirtyEight utilizes district-level candidate polls and concluded that I’d draw more inspiration from FiveThirtyEight modeling due to the (presumably advantageous) inclusion of expert ratings. In retrospect, FiveThirtyEight and my own competitive model (which unlike my non-competitive model, made use of expert ratings) underpredicted Schrier’s performance.\nSo then, did the polls and expert ratings underestimate Schrier’s electoral chances this election cycle? Did Larkin underperform as a challenger in a poor economy? Is it the case that both were true? I think both Schrier succeeded and Larkin underperformed, and I have three main hypotheses: Schrier ran “the right type” of campaign, turnout and the issues on the ballot favored the Democrats, and Larkin’s Trump ties hindered his electoral bid.\nCampaign Messaging Makes A Difference “A rational candidate will exploit the electoral context to his or her advantage… For something about a candidate to be important to the electoral context, it must be something that the candidate cannot change or manipulate easily; and obviously, it must be something about which the voters care or can be made to care” (Vavreck, 2009).\nSchrier’s attempt at running the right type of campaign involved focused promotion of her pro-choice stance as a female physician (in comparison to her opponent’s anti-choice stance as a male non-doctor), promise of increased healthcare access and middle-class-friendly policies, and emphasis on the environment. Post-hoc, it’s clear that Schrier and her team ran the right campaign – an insurgent one, per Vavreck’s campaign typology –, as an incumbent in a bad economy who’s focusing on issues that benefit from public opinion, such as women’s reproductive rights and continued funding of Medicare. Both issues are overwhelming popular amongst Washingtonians (Pew Research Center, Northwest Progressive Institute). Abortion was an especially salient issue this election cycle across the country after the Dobbs decision in late June 2022, and according to this late October poll of WA adults, was the most important issue for Washingtonians too, followed closely by inflation. When broken down by sex or party affiliation, abortion becomes overwhelmingly salient for females and Democrats. Thus, Schrier’s messaging on this issue was critical to her surmounting of the incumbent punishment that would normally be expected with the poor economic conditions of the past year, defined by high inflation, high gas prices, and supply chain issues.\nIf consulted, Vavreck’s best advice for a candidate in Larkin’s position – a challenging party in a bad economy – would be to run a clarifying campaign that focuses strongly on the economy so that voters are certain about his relationship to the current economic situation. While Larkin did include the federal spending problem as one of his key issues, his primary focus was encapsulated in and made explicit by his slogan - “make crime illegal again.” Crime is generally an issue Republicans do well on, but according to Vavreck’s theory, as a clarifying campaign, Larkin’s should have directed more attention and time toward inflation, especially after it became clear via polls that other than abortion, inflation was the top issue for Washington voters. Amongst independents, it was an even bigger issue than abortion! It appears that Larkin failed to run a clarifying campaign, and Schrier ran a successful insurgent one.\nTurnout This year, like most midterms, saw decreased turnout compared to two years ago. That said, turnout favored Schrier. In King County’s portion of District 8, the major source of support for Schrier, turnout was 3 percentage points higher, at 68%, than the county average. In contrast, Pierce County, an important source of support for Larkin, saw decreased turnout since the last midterm (Crosscut). Additionally, Democrat Senate incumbent Murray won 53% of the vote in Pierce County this cycle, so it may also be possible that the turnout of pro-Democratic senatorial voters in Pierce County worked against Larkin down-ballot.\nWA-8’s population shares of 50+ year olds and households with $100,000+ income are larger than the national average, which are all Washingtonian groups that disproportionately support abortion rights (Pew Research Center). WA-8’s population share of Latinos is also lower than the national average, which works well for Schrier, as Latinos in Washington are twice as likely to be anti-abortion than not.\nThe Trump Card Trump endorsed over 250 candidates in this year’s midterms, and 82% of them won. However, once we filter the races for competitiveness, a Trump endorsement is not so clearly predictive of candidate performance. In fact, Trump endorsed the Republican candidate in 5 of the 36 most competitive House races, and 0 of them won their race (New York Times). While Larkin never secured an official Trump endorsement, he still ran a campaign marred by Trump rhetoric - “make crime illegal again”, “build the wall”, and “political outsider.” Ultimately, I believe Larkin failed to oust Schrier not only because he failed to run a proper clarifying campaign, but he also because he modeled his campaign after a pretty unpopular ex-President.\nReferences\n[1] CNN.

My main model consisted of a linear regression built off of 4 predictors (GDP absolute growth, generic ballot support for the House incumbent party, whether or not it was a midterm year for the incumbent/President’s party, and the congressional approval rate). To achieve the two goals, I swapped out the response variable as needed.\nUltimately, I predicted that the House incumbent party (Democrats this year) would earn 48.56% (47.36, 49.83) of the national two-party vote share and 209 (198, 221) seats.\nDistrict-Level Models My district-level modeling also consisted of two main goals: predict the vote share of the democratic candidate in competitive districts and predict the vote share of the democratic candidate in “non-competitive” districts. My approach was to build competitive linear regression models using average expert ratings of those races in addition to candidate incumbency status, and to build non-competitive ones using the last democratic candidate’s vote share as well as the current candidate’s incumbency.\nEvaluation Accuracy As of November 22, 2022, the Democrats have reportedly captured 48.47% of the two-party vote share and 213 of the 435 seats (Cook Political Report, NYTimes).\nA quick glance tells us that my national model’s national vote share prediction was within 0.5 percentage points of the actual, and seat count prediction was off by 4 seats.\nThe table below provides a more detailed report on the accuracy of my national and district-level models, with measures of root mean squared error (RMSE), number of miscalled districts, classification accuracy, and the average margin by which the predicted vote shares were inaccurate.\nModel RMSE Miscalled Districts Classification Accuracy Avg. Inaccuracy Margin (D) National Two-Party Vote Share 0.09 - - - (D) TP Vote Share, Non-Competitive Districts 13.47 25/306 0.92 9.61 (D) TP Vote Share, Competitive Districts 12.03 46/94 0.51 6.85 My national vote-share prediction was considerably close, with a somewhat tight confidence interval of (47.36, 49.83) and center of 48.56%. As shown above, the RMSE of my national prediction is very small. That said, it was the simpler half of my modeling, with no purview into how each district-level race would play out.\nThe performance of my district-level models was a little less impressive, with RMSEs of 13.47 and 12.03 for the non-competitive and competitive models respectively. Though the non-competitive models had higher RMSE and average inaccuracy margin (which I define as the average difference between the actual Democratic candidate vote share and my prediction), they have a much higher classification accuracy than the competitive models. This was initially counterintuitive, but ultimately makes sense considering that the competitive models have a much harder classification task, with each race being close - even very small swings in vote share can alter each district’s outcome and classification. In contrast, the non-competitive models can afford to be less accurate in vote-share prediction so long as they correctly call the outcome. Indeed, over 90% of incumbents win re-election, so the inclusion of incumbency was expected to help call the non-competitive races accurately (OpenSecrets). Though, in retrospect, the incumbency variable wasn’t informative enough to accurately predict vote share with high accuracy in these districts, as reflected by their large RMSEs and inaccuracy margins.\nBelow are maps of the congressional districts I made predictions for, the first being colored according to how close (or far) my two-party vote share predictions were, and the second being colored by correct-call or miscall status.\nMargins\nOverall, it seems I tend to overpredict the Democratic candidate’s vote share, especially in the South. However, my single largest inaccuracy was in Maryland 6, where I severely underpredicted the (D) vote share and overpredicted the (R) vote share. Other than that miscall, my underpredictions of (D) performance were concentrated in southern California and western Arizona. In fact, 16 of my 25 non-competitive misclassifications come from California and Arizona, with 14 from California alone.\nI produced the map below to help evaluate my models’ classification performances at a glance. Red denotes a miscalled or misclassified district, and green denotes a correct call.\nClassification\nMy models had the most trouble predicting the outcomes and vote shares of districts in the Southwest and West, located in California, Nevada, Arizona, and New Mexico. There are also pockets of misclassification across the Great Lakes states, but they don’t appear particularly concentrated in any one area. Interestingly, my models did particularly well in New York, which was a state of difficulty for both FiveThirtyEight and The Economist. Both models miscalled NY-3, NY-4, NY-17, NY-19, and NY-22, but mine only did so for NY-4 and NY-17, with inaccuracy margins of just 5.5 and 0.9 percentage points.\nInaccuracy Sources There are many ways to explain the inaccuracy of my district models. I have several hypotheses regarding redistricting, turnout, and coding decisions that I believe decreased the accuracy of my predictive models at the district level.\nRedistricting One of the main sources of inaccuracy in my model is likely the redistricting that occurred in 2020. All of the data I used to build out my OLS models came from 2020 and prior, so my models are not perfectly tuned to the sentiments and voting behavior of the citizens in each 2022 congressional district. In Texas, Montana, and Florida, Republicans have gained new safe districts; in Colorado, Oregon, and North Carolina, Democrats did the same (Politico). The two maps above demonstrate how poorly my models performed in these states, with the training data not properly matching the regions for which I made 2022 predictions for due to the redistricting war.\nTurnout Post-election, it is clear that including a turnout in the model in some way would’ve been very helpful in gauging who will come out to vote, and who their vote will be cast for.\nYouth Turnout This year, young (19-29) turned out in historic numbers (CIRCLE). Some pundits and analysts believe it is the youth vote that helped Democrats stave off a “Republican wave”, with youth turnout being the second-highest it’s been in the last 30 years and youth preferring Democratic candidates over Republican ones by a 28-point margin. In key battleground states, the margin was even larger for the youth vote in competitive senatorial and gubernatorial races. This youth vote could partially explain how Democrats overperformed what my model predicted and had a particularly strong year as the president’s party in an arguably poor economy, and I believe my lack of consideration of a youth turnout variable led to an underprediction of Democrat seat count.\nGeneral Turnout Another theory related to turnout is that high-profile senatorial and gubernatorial races in certain states (such as Arizona, Nevada, Pennsylvania, and Georgia) this year may have incentivized higher Democratic voter turnout than other years due to perceived threats to abortions rights, democracy, party power, and more. This increased turnout could have led to down-ballot success for the Democratic party, and again, my lack of variable to account for particularly high-profile, high-turnout races likely led to an underprediction of Democratic candidate success in affected regions and races.\nCoding Most of my competitive-district models were trained on low quantities of past data, since expert ratings were required and can only be found dating back to 2010 - so, 5 midterms to train on. This meant that I had to sacrifice data quantity in order to incorporate expert ratings into my competitive model. In retrospect, I believe that such low amounts of training data resulted in underfitting in some cases, as there weren’t enough consistent trends to learn from for certain districts, and overfitting in other cases, such as when certain districts had severely lopsided support for one party in all 5 training data points, but underwent redistricting and/or significant changes this election cycle. As a result, the competitive models weren’t particularly accurate at predicting the vote share and outcome of the 94 most competitive districts.\nI also believe that (lack of) coding for uncontested races was a source of error in my models. After developing my competitive and non-competitive models, I made predictions for this year’s Democratic candidates. However, certain races were uncontested, and yet, still treated like the other standard multi-candidate races. Failing to account for uncontested races introduced unnecessary work into my model prediction process, and allowed for inaccuracy margins that shouldn’t have existed. For example, California 15, 16, 29, 30, 34, and 37 were all uncontested (no Republican candidates) races where Democrats candidate earned all 100% of the two-party vote share. I called all of these districts correctly, but unfortunately gave non-100 vote share predictions.\nTesting Inaccuracy Hypotheses Below I propose some simple tests to quickly see if the above sources of inaccuracy were indeed difference-makers in how my models performed this year.\nRedistricting To test my hypothesis about the negative effect of redistricting on my model performance, I could run the models again after correcting for redistricting. Mapping the train data by region to the new corresponding district, or mapping the new election data to old district lines, would adequately account for redistricting changes, and my new predictions can be evaluated the same way my current predictions are. A comparison of RMSEs, classification accuracies, and average inaccuracy margins should reveal just how much redistricting threw off my 2022 models.\nTurnout Youth turnout percentage could have been included as a predictor in my models, assuming the data is available as far back as the training data requires. As for high-profile races, an indicator variable for Senate race in the state or variable for the number of ballot measures could’ve been included. Again, we could compare the performance of these new models to that of the current ones to see how much, if at all, turnout was predictive of race outcomes.\nCoding After adding in an indicator variable for un/contested seat in both the competitive and non-competitive versions of the district models and acquiring more longitudinal data so that the number of training data points is sufficiently large (or at least greater than the 5 we’re currently working with), we could conduct a test like a difference-in-means test to see if there’s a meaningful difference in model performance (classification accuracy, mean inaccuracy margin of vote share prediction, etc.) when we change the training data and processing of candidates.\nLooking Forward I have several ideas for improvement in model performance and creation should I do this again (which I probably will, because this has been great fun and very intellectually rewarding).\nFigure 1: Source: Election Analytics 2022. Broadly, I’d make a few changes on the approach-side: split national vote share and national seat count into two different linear regression projects (allowing for different predictors in each model), spend more time tuning my district-level models with expert ratings and fundamental predictors, and study the experts’ models more closely. I tried my best to use the literature and lectures reviewed in Gov 1347, as well as my own insights, to build out this year’s models with the primary goal of learning, but next time, I plan to improve more directly on models from professional forecasters like The Economist and FiveThirtyEight with heavier prioritization on model performance and prediction accuracy.\nModel Choice Alongside those general approach improvements, I also envision some related specific technical ones regarding model choice and variable selection. I touch on model choice first; now that I’ve created, trained, validated, and predicted with over 400 OLS linear regression models, I feel ready to try more advanced modelling methods like Random Forest or bagging that don’t assume linearity. Ideally, I’d be able to get linear regression and Random Forest models up and running far in advance of the midterms to compare them. I’d also like to pool my district-level models next time around should they end up linear again.\nAnother model-related change I’d really like to make is to run simulations to get probabilities of Democrat and/or Republican wins in each district. This should increase at-a-glance interpretability, and also allow for post-election Brier score calculations.\nVariables As mentioned in my discussion of potential sources of inaccuracy, I’d like to consider youth turnout, high-profile race-presence, and seat contested-ness in my next rounds of variable selection. Below are some additional variables that are interesting to consider closely.\nEconomic Variables In the construction of my national model, I struggled somewhat to pick the best economic variable to include, settling finally on GDP growth in absolute terms. Though it was certainly predictive, I felt that it was hard to interpret and justify, so I hope to find better economic variable(s) in my next attempt. I also hope to find some variables that are data-dense even at the district level so that I can try to come close to a truly fundamentals-based forecast of districts.\nCandidate Quality There’s been a lot of chatter about the impact of Trump endorsements on the performance of Republican candidates and on how the 2022 midterms played out. I would like to consider candidate quality more closely in my 2024 attempt. This could involve many variables, such as fundraising abilities, presidential endorsements, and polling numbers. We briefly discussed the differential impacts of endorsements in class, so perhaps an interaction term of presidential_endorsement * endorsers_last_vote_share or endorsers_approval_rating could capture the possible effects of a presidential endorsement.\nSpecial Election Performance A week after Election Day, Elliott Morris (who we had the pleasure of hosting as a guest speaker to our course in October) and Dan Rosenheck of the Economist wrote that special election results in each midterm cycle are generally very good predictors of actual two-party vote share, being even more accurate than the generic-ballot polls (The Economist). My national model greatly benefited from the addition of generic ballot numbers, so I look forward to seeing how special election results stack up.\nFinal Reflections As I finish reflecting upon my 2022 forecasts and I look forward, I realize that I’ve learned a great deal developing these election forecasts over the past 9 weeks. It’s been a pleasure sharing my insights and lessons learned with you, and I thank you for following along. Every week’s brought a new challenge, and I’ve gained something from each one.

It’s been a long journey of election research and data analysis, but alas, we are one day out from Election Day. In today’s blog post, I am going to present my final predictions in detail, which will involve model formulas, model descriptions, model coefficients, model interpretations, model validation, prediction confidence intervals, and visualizations for my national and district-level models.\nFigure 1: Source: The Economist. National Model Starting in week 2, I wanted to build out a good national model with a mix of fundamental variables to predict the national two-party vote shares of the parties. I ultimately chose to stick with fundamentals because in weeks 5 and 6, I found that campaign activity, whether it be on air or on the ground, didn’t significantly or directly impact electoral outcomes. In week 7, I reached the same conclusion regarding shocks during the election cycle.\nThe best iteration of my model is the most recent one, which includes only 4 predictors: absolute GDP growth (Quarter 8, the last of the election cycle), the average generic ballot support of the House incumbent party (weighted by recency of the poll), an indicator for whether or not the House incumbent party is also the president’s party during a midterm year, and the average congressional approval rate. Absolute GDP growth is the economic variable I chose to capture how voters reward and punish the incumbent House party, and it came about after multiple considerations of other economic variables like unemployment rate, GDP growth percentage, and RDI change percentage. Average generic ballot support of the party in control of the House, introduced in week 3, reflects how much the nation wants the currently-leading party to retain that congressional power. The binary indicator for President's-Party-House-Incumbent-Midterm is my attempt to capture the well-known fact that the president’s party consistently performs poorly in midterm elections, which I covered in week 1. The indicator is equal to 1 if the party in control of the House happens to be the president’s party in a midterm year, and to 0 otherwise. Lastly, the average congressional approval rate was included because I believe it gives us a sense of how satisfied voters are with Congress, generally. This is distinct from the generic ballot support metric, with the former telling us how much voters like Congress’s performance, which (perhaps unintuitively) doesn’t match 1-to-1 with how much voters want the incumbent party to stay in power.\nFigure 2: Disconnect between Congressional Approval and Incumbent Generic Ballot. As shown above, generic ballot support for the incumbent party in the House doesn’t move with general approval of Congress! This was surprising to me at first, but was a good sign that I wasn’t introducing too much collinearity into my model by including both measures.\nModel Details Vote Share Formula I wanted to use this model to predict both national incumbent two-party vote share and national incumbent seat count, so I came up with two final regression formulas that incorporated the aforementioned fundamental predictors.\nNational Democratic Two-Party Vote Share Regression Formula.\nVote Share Regression In modeling the incumbent party’s two-party vote share, which is the Democrat’s vote share this election, we get some interesting coefficients. See below for this model’s coefficient values, variable significance, and the model’s overall evaluation metrics (like R-squared and adjusted R-squared).\nFigure 3: National Democratic Two-Party Vote Share Regression Output. The small, but negative, coefficient attached to absolute GDP is rather unintuitive, but my hypothesis is that for GDP, voters respond to levels and relative change differently. Previous weeks’ work has shown that positive percentage change is associated with higher incumbent vote share, as we’d expect, but positive absolute change is negatively correlated with incumbent party vote share perhaps because voters slightly punish incumbents when they deem the absolute change is not “large enough.” For every additional billion dollars of GDP change between the 7th and 8th quarters, the incumbent party loses 0.014 percentage points.\nThe generic ballot support variable has a coefficient of 0.472, which makes sense - if voters generally support the incumbent party in polls, the party can expect to do well on Election Day. For every percentage point higher the generic ballot support is for the incumbent party in polls, the incumbent party earns an additional 0.472 percentage point of vote share.\nThe only variable with a larger coefficient than generic ballot support is the president’s-party-incumbent-midterm variable. Midterm years in which the incumbent party is the president’s party see the incumbent party losing 2.788 percentage points of vote share. This is consistent with the decades of poor president’s party House performance we’ve observed.\nLastly, with every 1 percentage point increase in congressional approval, the incumbent party gains 0.092 percentage points in vote share. Again, this makes sense, as more voter satisfaction with the current Congress should be correlated with higher electoral support for the House incumbent party to remain in power.\nI would like to quickly note my model’s final adjusted R-squared, 0.872, which is a nice improvement from week 2’s 0.292. This value indicates that the model, with its 4 predictors, can explain about 87.2% of the variance in incumbent party vote share.\nVote Share Validation (#fig:vote share validation printout)National Democratic Two-Party Vote Share Model Validation. Above is the histogram of the mean out-of-sample residuals over 1,000 runs of cross-validation for my model. The distribution looks roughly normally distributed, with a mean a little below 0, tiny tails, and most residuals within [-2, 2].\nSeat Count Formula Next, I ran the same model again, but this time with incumbent party seat count as the response variable. Below are the regression formula and regression output for this model. Seat Count Regression Figure 4: National Democratic Seat Count Regression Output. The model coefficients of the seat count model have the same signs as those of the vote share model, but different magnitudes because of the switch from predicting vote share, which can only be in the interval [0, 100], to predicting seat count, which can be [0, 435]. It is really the sign of the coefficients that matter for interpretation, and since those haven’t changed, I will only briefly comment on this regression output.\nIt’s helpful to see the relationship between the president’s-party-incumbent-midterm effect and seat count because now, it becomes clear that when the president’s party is trying to defend its House incumbency in midterm years, like this year, it faces a steep uphill battle - when the indicator variable is 1, and everything else is held constant, the incumbent party is predicted to lose around 29 seats.\nSeat Count Validation (#fig:seat count validation printout)National Democratic Party Seat Count Model Validation. Above is the histogram of the mean out-of-sample residuals over 1,000 runs of cross-validation for my model again, this time for prediction of incumbent seat count. The distribution looks roughly normally distributed, with a mean at around 0 and most residuals within [-20, 20]. Neither our vote share nor our seat count model seem to perform poorly when tested with out-of-sample data, so we may move forward with prediction now!\nNational Predictions Using the two models above, and the newest data for the 2022 midterms, I predict that the House incumbent (Democratic Party) two-party vote share will be 48.56% (47.36, 49.83) and the seat count will be 209 (198, 221).\nThe GDP data comes from FRED, the generic ballot data comes from FiveThirtyEight, and the congressional approval numbers come from Gallup. Figure 5: 435 Seats Up For Grabs. District Models Since week 4, I have been slowly working towards building 435 models for the 435 district races. After much consideration, I decided to build two types of models: (1) the competitive type, which involves the average of many expert predictions and incumbency, and (2) the non-competitive type, which involves past election results and incumbency.\nMost expert ratings were pulled from Wikipedia’s election ratings pages for each election (see this year’s page here), and districts are determined to be competitive if one of the major rating groups considered them not “safe” or “solid”.\nModel Details The main difference in variable selection between the competitive and non-competitive models boils down to the fact that naturally, there is a lot more coverage of the competitive ones, meaning more expert rating availability. Because of this, the competitive district models feature an average of about 7 expert ratings, whereas the non-competitive ones feature none.\nFor the competitive districts, I used the following regression formula: These models ended up with an average R-squared of 0.88 and average adjusted R-squared of 0.49.\nDeveloping models for the non-competitive models was a journey - over the weeks, I realized that good district-level data is hard to come by, and with Election Day drawing near, I felt there was a choice between building out a self-made model and building a highly predictive one to be made. In the end, I decided to go with the former, in the name of learning. The models then are fundamentals-based than the competitive ones, using the major vote share of the last Democrat candidate in addition to the incumbency of the current candidate.\nNon-competitive District Model Formula.\nI chose to use these variables because House elections have historically favored incumbent candidates, and I believe that how the Democrat performed in each district in previous years can tell us a lot about how the Democratic candidate will perform this year.\nThe histogram above illustrates the coefficient values for the incumbent variable over the many non-competitive districts. The average coefficient value is a little under 16, and it indicates that on average, when a Democratic candidate is an incumbent, their vote share is expected to be about 16 points higher than had they not been an incumbent. This definitely tracks with what we know about the incumbency advantage for House members.\nThis histogram shows the coefficient values for the last Democrat’s vote share (in the previous election), and the mean is value is 0.36. The numerical interpretation of this one is a little confusing, but the main takeaway is that the vast majority of these coefficients are positive, indicating that the higher the last Democrat’s vote share, the higher we can expect this year’s Democratic vote share to be.\nThese models have an average R-squared of 0.50 and average adjusted R-squared of 0.45.\nDistrict Predictions Below are my predictions for the 94 most competitive districts, using expert ratings and incumbency:\nstate district fitted lower upper winner Alaska 48.03 39.87 56.19 Republican Arizona 1 50.69 48.53 52.85 Democrat Arizona 2 48.63 46.86 50.41 Republican Arizona 6 48.19 Republican California 3 63.11 Democrat California 9 56.05 Democrat California 21 50.42 40.34 60.50 Democrat California 22 60.08 Democrat California 25 58.31 56.56 60.06 Democrat California 26 54.77 Democrat California 45 51.94 Democrat California 47 58.68 Democrat California 49 50.06 Democrat Colorado 3 49.12 44.16 54.08 Republican Colorado 7 55.14 Democrat Connecticut 4 49.58 Republican Connecticut 5 54.31 Democrat Florida 2 53.01 37.20 68.81 Democrat Florida 7 60.77 Democrat Florida 13 48.43 40.72 56.13 Republican Florida 15 48.92 Republican Florida 16 42.36 14.85 69.86 Republican Florida 22 47.55 Republican Florida 27 44.33 Republican Georgia 6 52.09 Democrat Georgia 12 53.79 Democrat Illinois 6 53.55 Democrat Illinois 8 30.01 Republican Illinois 11 47.95 Republican Illinois 13 49.98 44.12 55.85 Republican Illinois 14 47.81 Republican Illinois 17 48.01 42.06 53.96 Republican Iowa 1 45.37 42.62 48.13 Republican Iowa 2 50.21 46.16 54.25 Democrat Iowa 3 44.55 40.28 48.83 Republican Kansas 3 43.95 41.48 46.41 Republican Maine 2 52.23 39.17 65.29 Democrat Maryland 6 -34.28 Republican Michigan 3 47.56 46.27 48.86 Republican Michigan 7 45.56 37.74 53.37 Republican Michigan 8 46.25 39.60 52.90 Republican Michigan 11 46.06 45.27 46.85 Republican Minnesota 1 51.53 48.75 54.31 Democrat Minnesota 2 48.04 42.69 53.39 Republican Minnesota 3 40.77 Republican Minnesota 8 48.83 45.40 52.25 Republican Missouri 2 46.53 Republican Nebraska 2 48.86 40.07 57.65 Republican Nevada 3 50.52 46.07 54.97 Democrat Nevada 4 47.87 41.31 54.42 Republican New Hampshire 1 48.43 46.18 50.68 Republican New Hampshire 2 53.41 49.42 57.40 Democrat New Jersey 2 46.43 Republican New Jersey 3 49.81 47.96 51.67 Republican New Jersey 5 49.09 43.58 54.59 Republican New Jersey 7 46.93 Republican New Jersey 11 60.44 Democrat New Mexico 1 48.06 Republican New Mexico 2 46.11 Republican New York 1 49.26 44.71 53.82 Republican New York 2 46.52 Republican New York 3 46.90 Republican New York 4 53.62 Democrat New York 11 46.78 36.22 57.33 Republican New York 18 49.85 48.17 51.53 Republican New York 19 47.34 42.75 51.93 Republican New York 22 47.50 45.59 49.41 Republican New York 25 49.11 22.92 75.29 Republican North Carolina 6 53.43 Democrat North Carolina 7 50.56 43.87 57.24 Democrat North Carolina 9 49.77 Republican North Carolina 13 48.93 Republican Ohio 1 46.03 44.22 47.85 Republican Ohio 7 62.47 Democrat Ohio 10 20.01 Republican Ohio 13 58.82 Democrat Ohio 15 47.43 Republican Oregon 5 52.66 51.18 54.14 Democrat Pennsylvania 1 50.84 Democrat Pennsylvania 6 51.10 50.18 52.03 Democrat Pennsylvania 7 43.89 36.33 51.44 Republican Pennsylvania 8 49.88 45.92 53.83 Republican Pennsylvania 10 43.75 Republican Pennsylvania 12 48.24 Republican Pennsylvania 17 41.72 33.97 49.46 Republican South Carolina 1 49.78 Republican Texas 23 48.19 45.35 51.03 Republican Virginia 2 48.85 48.41 49.30 Republican Virginia 5 49.62 45.13 54.11 Republican Virginia 7 50.98 Democrat Virginia 10 37.52 32.60 42.44 Republican Washington 3 50.43 46.39 54.47 Democrat Washington 8 47.24 Republican Wisconsin 3 44.73 34.39 55.07 Republican And the non-competitive district predictions, using past election results and incumbency: (#fig:district model viz)Note: Visualization of District-Level Predictions; Several Districts Mapped Imperfectly.

This post is affiliated with Gov 1347: Election Analytics, a course at Harvard University in the Government department.\nThe Plan This Week Last week, I investigated the impact of television advertisements on party success at the district level, and found a small, arguably negligible, effect. This week, I delve into the other major side of campaign activities – “the ground game.” Do the phone banks, text banks, rallies, door knockers, and more matter? I will incorporate these findings and retroactive ones (expert predictions from week 4) to make updates to my district-level model, newly featuring the effect of the ground game, expert predictions, and candidate incumbency. This will produce new district-level predictions for the races finalizing in the next 3 weeks!\nThe Ground Game As mentioned in my discussion of campaigns last week, political campaigns aim to mobilize supporters to vote, persuade potential voters to cast their ballot in favor of certain candidates, and encourage donations. In a 2018 study, it was found that across 49 field experiments, “the best estimate of the effects of campaign contact and advertising on Americans’ candidates choices in general elections is zero” (Kalla and Broockman). At the end of this research paper, Kalla and Broockman assert that though the ground game doesn’t seem to persuade voters to change their vote choice, these ground campaigns matter in other ways.\nThe consensus from the literature and pundit commentary is that the ground game – the fundraising, voter mobilization, person-to-person contact, field offices, and bottom-up political strategy of campaigns – does indeed matter. It certainly did for Obama, whose campaigns were studied extensively by political scientists. In 2012, turnout increased by about 7 percentage points in states that were highly-targeted by the ground arm of the major campaigns (Enos and Fowler, 2018). Even as early as 2008, President Obama’s campaigns were notably strong. The Atlantic praised Obama’s “sophisticated organization,” which debuted in 2008 as “the largest grassroots organization in the history of American politics” (Ball, 2012). A 2009 study found that counties with Obama campaign field offices had disproportionate increases in Democratic vote share (Masket), and a 2014 study found that the field offices increased county-level vote share by 1%, which in turn scored Obama ~275,000 votes in the 2008 election (Darr and Levendusky).\nThese findings suggest that successful ground campaigns increase turnout. In the remainder of my blog post this week, I want to explore the question of how increased turnout at the district level affects the parties’ respective vote shares, if at all? Does higher Democrat turnout correlate with better Democrat major vote share – which is rather intuitive –, or no – maybe higher Democrat turnout occurs with more Republican turnout, so there’s a “cancel-out” effect?\nMy 2022 Model and Forecast, Updated My previous district-level model was basic, relying on only average expert predictions. Though the predictions themselves consider many important electoral predictors, their aggregation and then averaging render them basic. This week, I aim to Incorporate turnout, incumbency and the generic ballot into my district-level model of Democratic major vote share.\nMy New Models I took two shots at redesigning my district-level model: one incorporated candidate incumbency, district-level turnout, and generic ballot support (Model A: DemVoteShare ~ incumbency + turnout + support), and the other incorporated the aforementioned with the exception of turnout (Model B: DemVoteShare ~ incumbency + support). I also prioritized producing 435 models, so that limited my data to only 2012-present day data, but I aim to reconsider this in the next blog post as I grapple with the decision of including expert predictions in my district-level models.\nBelow is a histogram of the adjusted R-squareds of Model A. As shown, there’s generally a lot of room for improvement, with many R-squareds being 0 or even negative. Considering turnout, the generic ballot, and incumbency is at times worse than just using the mean Democratic vote share to predict the race outcomes!\nI was curious if the turnout variable, which is this week’s proxy for the effect of the ground game, had significant predictive power. To test this quickly, I removed turnout as a predictor variable and developed a new set of 435 models. Below is the histogram of the adjusted R-squareds of Model B. This histogram, again, demonstrates the models have much room for improvement. Interestingly, removing the turnout predictor has not greatly reduced our R-squareds, with the average adjusted R-squared for Model B actually being higher than that of Model A. This one rudimentary test seems to suggest that turnout is not a great predictor of Democrat vote share; changes in turnout are not highly correlated with better or worse Democrat performance.\nI also tried to incorporate turnout into my national model. Below is the Stargazer table showing my regression outputs. On the left is the previous national model I developed in week 3, the middle is the new model with turnout incorporated, and on the right is the final national model I chose to come away from this week with.\nNational Regression Models\nThe upside of my national models regression is that 3 models is much easier to interpret and compare than 435. The first two columns show the coefficients for the old model, and the old model with turnout. As shown, adding turnout does not significantly change the adjusted R-squared of the model; in fact, adding turnout drives up the residual standard error. Additionally, turnout does not appear to be a significant predictor (0 stars) of House incumbent party (Democrats) vote share. I took these findings, as well as the observation that unemployment appears to be another poor predictor of vote share, to form my newest national model, which predicts House vote share for the incumbent House party using GDP growth %, RDI change %, GDP absolute growth %, the president’s-party-midterm interaction, and generic ballot support.\nMy New Forecast Next week, I hope to improve my district-level models by re-incorporating expert predictions. After some final touch-ups, I will produce new district-level predictions in time for Election Day.\nAs for the national model, I was able to come up with new predictions using the newest iteration of my national model and the newest economic and generic ballot support data available online. The Democrats, as the incumbent majority party of the House, is expected to win 47.35% of the two-party major vote share, with 95% confidence interval (46.01, 48.68). I also built a model to predict incumbent seats using the same exact predictor variables, and predict taht the Democrats will win ~203 seats in a few weeks’ time, with a confidence interval of (193, 213).\nReferences\n[1] Kalla, \u0026amp; Broockman, D.

After evaluating the historical impact of “the Air War” on elections, I plan to update my simple district-level model from last week.\nAre Advertisements Impactful? To explore this week’s central question, I took a look at data from the Wesleyan Media Project about political campaign advertisements for campaigns from 2006 through 2018.\nI first wanted to visually inspect the relationship between advertisement volume and party major vote share at the district level for House races, and found unpromising results. As shown in the above 2 plots, there’s no clear correlation between the number of partisan advertisements run and the party’s major vote share in a given district. As the number of advertisements run for each party increases, the party’s major vote share doesn’t increase or decrease.\nThough there’s no positive or negative correlation that immediately jumps out from these plots, there are still valuable insights to note. For one, there’s great variability in party vote share when there are a low number of advertisements run in that district - with close to 0 ads run for the Democrat candidate in a district, the candidate can have anywhere from 25% to 100% of the vote share. The same is true for Republican candidates and lack of Republican advertisements. As the numbers of advertisement run increases, towards the magnitudes of 15,000 and beyond, the races become much more competitive, with each party securing about 50% of the major party vote share. This finding is intuitive, in a way, because we could imagine the reason these districts were sites of unprecedented advertisement war was because their races were highly competitive and anticipated.\nI was also curious about spending on advertisements versus the promoted candidate’s vote share. Below is the plot of the total estimated cost of advertisements promoting a Democratic candidate against the amount of money spent on their advertising campaign. The same trends from above apply here – at the lower end of advertisement campaign strength and cost, the Democrat major vote share varies widely across different House races. At the higher end of spending, the races remain competitive, with Democrats just edging out their competitors with vote shares hovering slightly above 50%.\nTo formally check the relationship between advertisement volume and party major vote share in a district, I ran linear regressions across the districts with available data, predicting Democrat major vote share on the ratio of Democrat:Republican advertisements ran in that cycle. The results are interesting. The first observation is that the ratio of partisan advertisement volume alone is a poor predictor of Democrat vote share – my model only has an adjusted R-squared of 0.054. Another is that when the ratio of Democrat:Republican advertisements moves from 0 to 1, the Democrat vote share increases by ~6.2 percentage points.\nEvaluation and Looking Forward 6.2 is, of course, a huge increase in major vote share, but the way I built my model hinders interpretability and generalization because I can only make the +6.2 p.p. claim when the advertisement situation goes from no Democrat advertisements to all Democrat advertisements in a district. All things considered, I plan to rethink the way I evaluate advertisement data as a predictor of historical races before incorporating it into my district-level model. Right now, I hesitate to add it to my model in addition to expert ratings because it may be better to scrap the variable altogether, considering the low predictive power advertisement volume has as a feature in my model. For now, I will refrain from making changes to my national and district-level models from last week, and I look forward to perhaps incorporating advertisement data in tandem with district-level candidate incumbency, or with other forms of candidate campaigning, like the ground game and its field offices, volunteers, rallies, and person-to-person contacts in the future. This week’s exploration has revealed to me that the “Air War” is very real, but it’s unclear how impactful it really is on candidate success in House races.\nReferences\n[1] Cook Political Report.

With these models in mind, I updated my own 2022 midterm forecast and model to include national economic conditions (Gross Domestic Product, Real Disposable Income, and unemployment), generic ballot polls (partisan preference), and the midterm-president’s-party effect.\nOne of the most interesting differences between the two models was that FiveThirtyEight explicitly mentions their use of expert forecasts (Cook Political Report, Inside Elections, and Sabato’s Crystal Ball) to predict future elections. Expert forecasts are intuitively a strong predictor of the race outcomes, as they are the best predictions elections experts have given all they data they gathered. This week, I wanted to investigate how accurate these expert predictions really are, specifically for the 2018 midterms.\nHow Accurate Are Expert Predictions? To conduct this week’s investigation, I compare the actual results of the 2018 midterm elections to the average election ratings of experts. The 2018 results shown below are Democrat vote shares in each district. The 2018 expert election ratings come from Ballotpedia, with the election ratings taking on integer values 1 through 7 – 1 represents a Solid/Safe Democrat prediction and 7 represents a Solid/Safe Republican average expert prediction for each district.\nActual Vote Share in 2018, by District Below is the actual (D) vote share in the 2018 midterm elections at the district level.\nActual 2018 (D) Vote Share.\nMost of the map is either red or white, which seems to suggest that most district vote share results were in the Republican party’s favor or close between the two major parties. However, it is important to remember that for the House of Representatives, land is not proportional to representation, population is. Also, the president’s party often performs poorly in midterm years, as discussed in detail in the first blog post of this series. Those two reminders considered, it then makes sense that the Democrats actually took the House in the 2018 midterms, with 235 seats going to Democrats and 199 going to Republicans (New York Times 2018).\nExpert Predictions for Vote Share in 2018, by District Below are the expert ratings for the 2018 midterms, which I call predictions because the ratings reflect what the experts believed would happen in each congressional district election. Red areas represent high expert confidence that the region will go to Republicans, while blue areas represent high confidence that the region will go to Democrats. Evaluation For the most part, the predictions are pretty accurate via visual investigation. Most of the areas that actually had majority-Republican vote shares in the 2018 elections were predicted to be likely or solidly Republican by the experts on average. The blue districts of the 2018 midterms, like the ones along the west coast of Washington, Oregon, and California, in Arizona and New Mexico, in southern Texas, and scattered throughout the Rust Belt, were impressively predicted by the experts and their ratings, reflected in the standout blue coloring in the plot above. The experts were also able to pin down the close races, like the ones in southern New Mexico and in Maine. Overall, I think the average expert ratings predicted the congressional races at the district level very well, despite being just one predictor (that is a culmination of many predictors considered by the experts) in my model.\nMy 2022 Model and Forecast, Updated My New Model My national model remains the same as it was last week, and I cannot fully extend my national model to the district level because it uses national variables like GDP change, as well as national responses to the generic ballot polls. That said, I can incorporate this week’s investigation into a district-level model that predicts the House races by district using the most recent expert ratings data I have access to. These district-level models are of course imperfect because they only use expert ratings, but across all of them, they have an average R-squared of 0.78.\nMy New Forecast Below are my models’ predictions for the major vote share taken by Democrats for the 94 congressional districts where the expert ratings were available.\nstate district pred Alaska AL 48.03 Arizona 1 51.30 Arizona 2 49.10 Arizona 6 48.19 California 21 48.30 California 22 60.08 California 25 58.31 California 26 54.77 California 3 49.02 California 45 51.94 California 47 58.68 California 49 50.06 California 9 56.05 Colorado 3 48.72 Colorado 7 55.14 Connecticut 4 49.58 Connecticut 5 51.77 Florida 13 49.10 Florida 15 48.92 Florida 16 42.36 Florida 2 52.57 Florida 22 47.55 Florida 27 48.87 Florida 7 51.79 Georgia 12 53.79 Georgia 6 52.09 Illinois 11 50.91 Illinois 13 49.98 Illinois 14 49.43 Illinois 17 49.32 Illinois 6 53.55 Illinois 8 51.17 Iowa 1 47.23 Iowa 2 48.58 Iowa 3 47.41 Kansas 3 48.34 Maine 2 47.16 Maryland 6 70.30 Michigan 11 49.35 Michigan 3 47.56 Michigan 7 45.56 Michigan 8 48.92 Minnesota 1 49.60 Minnesota 2 49.52 Minnesota 3 49.31 Minnesota 8 50.25 Missouri 2 46.53 Nebraska 2 50.03 Nevada 3 50.07 Nevada 4 52.93 New Hampshire 1 49.69 New Hampshire 2 51.32 New Jersey 11 60.44 New Jersey 2 46.43 New Jersey 3 49.77 New Jersey 5 50.37 New Jersey 7 49.27 New Mexico 1 50.81 New Mexico 2 48.27 New York 1 48.92 New York 11 45.26 New York 18 51.87 New York 19 48.23 New York 2 46.52 New York 22 48.60 New York 25 49.11 New York 3 46.90 New York 4 53.23 North Carolina 13 48.93 North Carolina 6 53.43 North Carolina 7 51.02 North Carolina 9 49.77 Ohio 1 46.03 Ohio 10 20.01 Ohio 13 58.82 Ohio 15 47.43 Ohio 7 62.47 Oregon 5 52.66 Pennsylvania 1 50.84 Pennsylvania 10 46.13 Pennsylvania 12 48.24 Pennsylvania 17 41.72 Pennsylvania 6 51.10 Pennsylvania 7 48.00 Pennsylvania 8 47.94 South Carolina 1 49.78 Texas 23 49.28 Virginia 10 48.25 Virginia 2 50.30 Virginia 5 48.37 Virginia 7 50.98 Washington 3 50.43 Washington 8 50.44 Wisconsin 3 44.73 References\n[1] Ballotpedia.

These two findings have led me to forecast that the incumbent (President and House) Democrats will lose House vote share in November. This week, I delve into how forecasting giants like The Economist and FiveThirtyEight incorporate polls into their House predictions. Then, I examine how polling data can improve my predictions by investigating how predictive it’s been in past elections. After that, I will incorporate the latest polls to give a numerical prediction for the Democrat House vote share.\nWhat Do Forecasters Do? In general, election forecasters gather as much relevant data about elections as they can to predict the outcome of future ones. The prevailing question for them, and for students of government in Election Analytics, pertains to what data is relevant?\nThe Economist According to The Economist’s forecasting model report this year, polls are the best indicator for the outcome of House elections. Especially informative is the “generic ballot” question, which asks “If the elections for U.S. Congress were being held today, would you vote for the Republican Party’s candidate or the Democratic Party’s candidate for Congress in your district?” (Pew Research Center, 2002). As the countdown to Election Day dwindles, poll results are weighed more heavily, as they’re believed to be more reflective of the electorate than previous polls. Additionally, pollster quality over the years is also considered to correct for past estimation errors. The models also account for a slew of other predictors, including president’s party performance in special elections, the midterm-incumbent disadvantage, state-level partisan lean, and campaign finances.\nFiveThirtyEight FiveThirtyEight has become a renowned forecasting site, and is transparent about its methodology. In all versions of their House forecast, they consider thousands of polls (district-level), each weighted with pollster rating and quality in mind. For districts with low or no polling, they use the CANTOR system, which “infers results … from comparable districts that do have polling.” More complex versions of their modeling include the fundamentals (such as economics, fundraising, past elections results), and expert forecasts (Cook Political Report, Inside Elections, and Sabato’s Crystal Ball).\nComparison and Insights For the most part, The Economist and FiveThirtyEight methodologies appear to be similar. On a high level, they share many predictors: polls (weighted according to recency, pollster quality), previous election results, campaign finances, and other fundamentals, like the midterm-incumbent effect. Some small, but important, differences lie in the specifics of each predictor - for example, The Economist relies more on generic ballot polling data, while FiveThirtyEight utilizes district-level candidate polls. FiveThirtyEight includes expert ratings and forecasts in their model, which The Economist does not.\nI personally prefer the FiveThirtyEight model due to its inclusion of expert ratings. Though it seems initially a bit circular to build a predictive model based, in part, on others’ predictions, it ultimately makes sense – other experts have made their best guesses for election results, and on average, they probably are onto something. This idea is reminiscent of Galton’s (1907) “wisdom of the crowds,” but the crowds consist of pollsters and election forecasters here.\nMy 2022 Model and Forecast, Updated I take inspiration from the aforementioned models and update my own, incorporating national economic variables, the midterm-incumbent effect, and generic ballot polling data in order to predict the House incumbent party vote share for the upcoming election.\nThe economic variables are the exact same as the ones from last week; see here for more information. The PresParty-HouseInc-Midterm variable is meant to capture the midterm-incumbent effect, taking a value of: 1 for election years when there is a midterm election and the House incumbent party is the president’s party, 0 otherwise. In these years, we’d expect the House incumbent party to suffer in vote share, as it’s known that the president’s party, which is the same as the House incumbent party, performs poorly in midterm years. The generic ballot poll responses are taken into account via the Generic Ballot Average Support variable, which averages the generic ballot responses for each election year with respect to weighting that boost polls closer to Election Day, and dampen those farther out (Gelman and King, 1993).\nBelow is a regression table of several model editions I considered.\nThe “National Econ” Model comes from last week, and only considers the national economic variables of Gross Domestic Product growth (percentage and absolute), unemployment rate, and Real Disposable Income (RDI) change %. The adjusted R-squared is only 0.292, and few variables are clearly predictive of vote share.\nNext, I consider a model using only the midterm-incumbent effect and generic ballot support. Impressively, these two variables alone have an adjusted R-squared of 0.552.\nThe next two models consider economic variables and either polls, or the midterm-incumbent effect, but not both. It appears that the generic ballot polls provide more predictive power to my model than the midterm effect alone.\nMy New Model Lastly, my final model considers all the predictors we’ve conceptually explored up until this point - generic ballot polling data and fundamentals like national economic variables and midterm-incumbent effect. My adjusted R-squared is 0.769, and GDP growth %, RDI change %, GDP absolute growth, midterm-incumbency, and generic ballot support are all found to be significant predictors of House incumbent party vote share. When GDP growth % and generic ballot average support increase, we expect incumbent vote share to increase.\nInterestingly, negative RDI growth % and absolute GDP growth, as well as it not being a midterm year for an incumbent party that’s the president’s party, are associated with increases in incumbent vote share. I plan to further investigate GDP growth in absolute terms versus percentage in future weeks – it’s fascinating because even though the two measures are correlated (0.7), removing one or the other significantly reduces the R-squared value of my model (by a magnitude of ~0.10). However, including both measures makes my model’s economic coefficients appear counterintuitive! In future weeks, I also hope to include expert predictions in my model as FiveThirtyEight does.\nMy New Forecast Considering the current economic conditions, generic ballot polls, and the fact that this year, the President’s party is trying to hold onto their House incumbency in the midterms, my model predicts the House incumbent party (D) will have a (two-party) vote share of 49.82%, with a confidence interval of (47.97, 51.66). My updated model predicts the Democrats will have a two-party seat share of 51.46%, (48.17, 54.75), which is roughly 223 seats (208.73, 237.57). As Steve Kornacki said, if the Democrats are to hold onto their House majority, it seems that it’ll be by the slimmest of margins.\nReferences\n[1] The Economist Newspaper. (2022).

By the 2020 House elections, the president’s party gained some of its vote share back.\nThis week, I temporarily move away from cyclical election study to delve into one of the most promising ways to predict election outcomes – economics. Retrospective voting, a model of voting in which voters elect leaders based off of recent experiences and judgment of welfare under incumbent leadership, dictates that for many elections, the results largely rely on the state of the economy in the last quarter of the election cycle (Achen \u0026amp; Bartels, 2017). For presidential elections, this means that national economic variables like GDP (gross domestic product), unemployment, and RDI (real disposable income) can account for a lot of the variation in incumbent candidate popularity. I explore this relationship between national economic variables and incumbent vote share, but for House races from 1948 to 2020. I want to know which variables accurately predict House incumbent party vote share, and build a model accordingly. Lastly, I will test my model with data from 2020 to see how well it would’ve predicted the last election.\nGDP, RDI, and Unemployment To start identifying which national economic variables predict House incumbent vote share well, I first investigated how Quarter 8 GDP growth (percentage), RDI change (percentage), and unemployment rate, individually, are related to incumbent party vote share. I specifically choose Quarter 8 because voters often refer to the latest memory they have of the economy to judge how the economy has performed under their incumbent leader(s) (Achen \u0026amp; Bartels, 2017. Healy \u0026amp; Lenz, 2014).\nScatter Plots.\nAs shown above, each variable, GDP growth, RDI change, and unemployment rate, respectively, are correlated to House incumbent vote share - as GDP growth percentage decreases, or RDI change percentage decreases, or unemployment rate grows, House incumbent vote share grows. These correlations are unintuitive, and suggest that voters do not accurately hold their leaders accountable according to national economic performance.\nThat said, these correlations are not too explanatory by themselves and may be very susceptible to noise, with R-squared values of 0.081, 0.056, and 0.131. I moved on from univariate relationships between these national economic variables House incumbent vote share to multivariable relationships, hoping to find a model that incorporates multiple economic variables to predict incumbent vote share. In this multivariable model (which I call Model 1), I consider the predictors GDP_growth_pct (GDP growth %), DSPIC_change_pct (RDI change %), GDP_growth_qt (GDP growth), and UNRATE (unemployment rate) to investigate how they influence incumbent vote share in conjunction.\nRegression Stargazer.\nModel 1 My development of Model 1 finds that GDP, RDI, and unemployment all influence House incumbent vote share, but in varying directions and with varying levels of statistical significance. For GDP growth (%), Model 1 anticipates that as it grows by 1, House incumbent vote share will too by 2.9, which makes more sense. However, for GDP growth (absolute) and unemployment rate, increases in these are still associated with decreases in incumbent vote share.\nThese results are again fascinating, as they are counter-intuitive and don’t follow the traditional knowledge political scientists lean on concerning retrospective voting, economic performance, and incumbent success. That said, Model 1 has an R-squared value of 0.386, which is much higher than the univariate R-squared values previously found.\nTo evaluate the performance of my model and choice of model, I check the residuals. As shown below, they are roughly normally distributed around a center point of 0. This tells me that the form of Model 1 (linear) is adequate.\nAfter checking that Model 1 performs well after being tested with 1,000 runs of cross-validation, with a mean-error of roughly 0, I move to applying Model 1 to the most recent data available for the national economic variables in the model. This data comes from Q2 2022, which is equivalent to Q6 of the current House. The reports indicate that in Q2 (or Q6), there was a -0.6% change in GDP, -0.6% change in RDI, -28.453 absolute change in GDPC1 (Real GDP, measured in billions of chained 2012 Dollars), and 3.6 national unemployment rate. With these inputs, Model 1 predicts that the incumbent party in the House (the Democratic Party) will have a vote share of 52.92% (50.20, 55.64).\nThis prediction is probably an overestimate given the fact that Model 1 did not account for the negative incumbent-midterm effect. Additionally, Model 1 should be used again once Q8 (so, Q4 of 2022) data becomes available to maximize its predictive power. The model can also be improved with wider purview into House incumbent seat share and totals. Lastly, Wright found that worsened (so, increased) unemployment affects Democrats differently than it does Republicans. Given more time, I would expore if this finding holds when we focus specifically on House elections.\nReferences\n[1] Achen, \u0026amp; Bartels, L. M. (2017). Democracy for realists (REV - Revised).

This post is affiliated with Gov 1347: Election Analytics, a course at Harvard University in the Government department.\nOver the next several weeks, I will be exploring previous U.S. elections data to analyze voter trends and behavior. This exploration will aide in my ultimate goal of forecasting the 2022 midterm election results. For this first blog, I focus on the House vote shares from 2016 to 2020 and how they changed over the course of Donald J. Trump’s term. I compare the results of 2016 House election, specifically the House Democratic Party vote share at the state level, to those of the 2018 midterm House election to see the extent to which the common theme of incumbent disadvantage applied to the House election results. I then compare the House Democratic vote share of the 2018 election to the 2020 House election, which saw the election of Joseph R. Biden. My hope is to identify the trends in House election swings in the Trump era. As we near the 2022 midterms, where the Democratic president’s party is campaigning hard to retain House control, it’ll be increasingly important to know which states have shown increased support for House Democrats in recent years.\nHouse Races in 2016, 2018, and 2020 To answer this question, I pulled data about the House party vote shares for 2016, 2018, and 2020. I show 2018-2016 and 2020-2018 comparison maps, which consist of states colored by the quantity \\(\\frac{D_y}{D_y + R_y} - \\frac{D_{y - 2}}{D_{y - 2} + R_{y - 2}}\\). This quantity is a measure of state swing in Democratic Party vote share for that House election, since the previous one. Below is the 2018-2016 swing map - negative (red) values show a decline in (D) House vote share in a given state since 2016, positive (blue) values show the opposite, and near-zero (white) values represent no change in (D) House vote.\nMy analysis confirms that the House elections of the 2018 midterms followed the traditional pattern of the president’s party performing rather poorly – With the exception of Connecticut, Hawaii, Massachusetts, Vermont, and Wyoming, the Democrats gained vote share in every state in comparison to the 2016 House elections. This pattern of president’s party disadvantage in midterms has been upheld at an incredibly high rate throughout the 20th and 21st century, and it is expected to hold in this year’s midterm elections.\nHowever, this swing against the executive party may reverse by the next House elections, and this was indeed true in 2020.\nUnlike the previous swing comparison, the 2020-2018 comparison reveals that most states saw a decline in (D) party vote share in the House elections of 2020. Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, Rhode Island, and Maine were the only states to not see a decline in (D) House vote share. Georgia was an anomaly, and huge victory for the Democrats, in the 2020 elections, where less than 13,000 popular votes (Politico) determined Biden’s victory in the electoral college and one House seat was flipped by the Democrats in district 7. Other than these 5 states, the Democrats lost vote share in nearly every state House election the Democrats but clinched the presidency by a decent margin (about 4 percentage points, Cook Political Report).\nMy dive into the 2018 and 2020 House election results and swings has revealed several observations: (1) Because the president’s party has always been known to suffer during midterms, and this tradition remained true in the 2018 midterms, it should be expected that the Democrats see this same poor performance in November. (2) Looking beyond the midterms, Democrats may be relieved to hear that the president’s party does seem to get some of their vote share back in House elections by the next general election. We saw that in 2020, House vote shares declined for Democrats in nearly all states. (3) It is important to study swings and temporally relative party performance to see how voters move in preference over different House elections, but it is also very important to study the House elections move in absolute terms – although observation (2) recognized that the president’s party does gain a lot of its lost House vote share back by the general election, 2020 showed us that this gain was ultimately not enough, with the challenger party taking the House, the Senate (by a hair), and the presidency.\nReferences\n[1] Campbell, J.

This is my “Playlist Producer.” I developed this project over the course of several weeks in my Spring 2022 semester, as a sophomore. At this point, I have newly rediscovered my love for computational thinking and problem solving, and want to apply my Python skills to a fun problem I’ve had for a while – my lack of new music. I am a Spotify loyalist, but I sometimes find that once I’ve exhausted my Daily Mix 1, I am in desperate need of more music to explore. So then, my motivating questions became: Can I get the same genre, but different (but not too different…) songs? Can I get the same artist vibe, but different (but not overly different…) artists? As I soon learned, personalization and recommendation are games of balance.\nThe Spotify Playlist Producer For project files, see the GitHub repository. Figure 1: Source: AudioHype. Project Purpose Mainly, the aim is to provide new and familiar song suggestions to Spotify users that are meaningfully related to their favorite artist and associated vibes. A subgoal was to use a non-invasive approach, so that users only needed to provide small amounts of information (rather than broad access to their account) for the suggestion algorithm to work.\nFundamentals In this project, I defined “new” to be music from artists other than the user’s favorite artist. “Old” or “familiar” generally refers to music from their artist, though I acknowledge that some songs from a user’s favorite artist may still nonetheless be new to them. “Favorite artist” can be whoever comes to mind to the user – their all-time favorite, their current favorite, their long-lost, but just-rediscovered favorite.\nComputational Breakdown Obtain playlist library to pull songs from to populate new playlists. I pulled the playlists to stock my library from samples of the Spotify Million Playlist Dataset. Take in user input about desired playlist length, their favorite artist, and how much of the playlist they’d like to be new versus old songs. The playlist length should be an integer between 1 and 30. The favorite artist should be a string entry, not case-sensitive. The last value should be between 0 and 100, which represents the percentage of the playlist the user would like to contain new music. There can be a lot more done towards the end of input validation, but there are some checks put in place to catch the egregious inputs. Populate the playlist with the desired number of familiar songs. Randomly peek into the playlists in my playlist library that contain songs from the user’s favorite artist. Pull from these until the desired number of familiar songs is reached. Populate the remainder of the playlist with new songs from the playlists that contain their favorite artist, but are from new artists. Randomly peek into playlists in the playlist library that contain songs from the user’s favorite artist. Pull songs from these playlists that are not from the favorite artist until the desired playlist length has been reached. Display new playlist and song suggestions, with artist credits. Print outs! Sample input and output \u0026lt;text\u0026gt; indicates user input Hi! Welcome to the Playlist Producer. It’s what it sounds like - I produce a playlist for you, and you enjoy it.\nHow many songs would you like in your playlist? \u0026lt;6\u0026gt;\nLife’s all about exploration. What percentage of the playlist would you like to be brand new? \u0026lt;50\u0026gt;\nPerfect. Let’s get a sense of what you like. Who is your favorite artist? \u0026lt;Drake\u0026gt; ———————————————————————— Here it is: a playlist 50% Drake and 50% new. Enjoy!\nControlla - Drake\nJumpman - Drake\nEnergy - Drake\nSmoke To It (feat. Skizzy Mars) - Marc E. Bassy\nSeason 2 Episode 3 - Glass Animals\nAll Eyes On You (feat. Chris Brown \u0026amp; Nicki Minaj) - Meek Mill\nLooking Forward To continue developing this project, I would provide the option to obtain an actual Spotify link to the new playlist. Another feature I’d love to explore is making the playlist based on favorite album or genre, which would require a drastic change in or addition to my algorithm. Lastly, I would also make my program more error-proof, as it takes in a considerable amount of user input that has to be accounted for… Also, deal with imperfect splits of new versus old songs in playlists (percentage request versus integer values).\n","date":"3 May 2022","permalink":"/personal/posts/2022-05-playlist-producer/","section":"Posts","summary":"Overview Hello!

At this point, I was gaining proficiency in R, but had not developed a sophisticated understanding of statistics and causal inference yet. That said, this paper was one of my first large data science projects, and was driven by my newfound passion for applying data science techniques and programming experience to (what I deem to be) relevant real-world problems. In Fall 2021, the pandemic was still a large public health concern, but the public was battling a mixture of fear and desire for a return to normalcy. I was very interested in what sources people trusted to provide them information about the pandemic, and how that related to their COVID anxieties – additionally, how does partisan alignment interact with these variables?\nAbstract Over the past two years, the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has disrupted the lives of billions of people, and has taken the lives of millions. In that time, American citizens have reported notable levels of concern about the pandemic (Albertson \u0026amp; Gadarian, 2020). Trust in government and officials is important in times of crisis, so how does the new spike in anxiety relate to trust? This paper analyzes the correlative relationship between concern about the pandemic and the trust that Americans have in their government and other important institutions. After observing 48 weeks of panel data of N ≈ 1,000 from the KnowledgePanel, it is revealed that there is a positive correlation between coronavirus concern and trust in state and federal government, as well as the CDC and national health officials. Additionally, it is shown that there exists a non-negligible factor of partisan identity in the determination of trust in these important information sources – an indicator of the pandemic’s unique politicization.\nTrust in Various Institutions Citizen trust in institutions, from health advisory bodies to different levels of government, for relevant information is important for a variety of reasons. During public health crises, trust in the advice of medical experts is correlated with increased personal commitment to safety measures that deter sickness (Goodwin et al., 2020). Increased public trust in government allows for more ready acceptance of containment policies, such as quarantine policies and medical testing, during pandemics (Van Bavel et al., 2020). These COVID-19-related insights are similar to those gathered during and after the 2014 Liberian Ebola Virus Disease epidemic: people who expressed low trust in the government were significantly less likely to comply with government-mandated social distancing policies, take precautions against the virus, and support other virus control and containment policies (Blair et al., 2017). Even away from the context of pandemics, the relationship between institutional trust and adherence to policies originating from or supported by that institution is rather intuitive; previous literature has discussed the positive correlative relationship between trust in government and law compliance (Marien \u0026amp; Hooghe, 2001).\nNot only do attitudes about COVID-19 policy and changes in trust have important consequences for the success of public health initiatives and planning, but they also may have an impact on electoral politics. Increased citizen trust in government and health advisory could contribute to previously studied “rally-round-the-flag” effects, where politicians gain popular support during times of national hardship (Mueller, 1970). Decreased trust in, perhaps paired with dissatisfaction with, government officials and their pandemic policies could sway election results against incumbents who are usually at an advantage otherwise–– a working paper by Noland and Zhang (2021) reports that if Donald Trump handled the pandemic about 20 percent better, or had the pandemic not happened at all, American citizen faith would not have decreased to a level that allowed Joseph Biden to win the 2020 election and claim the presidency.\nTrust as an Outcome Existing literature about trust in government, social trust, and the effects of trust has highlighted the importance of trust in times of crisis. In these works, trust in different institutions for important information about relevant events has been treated as an independent variable to assess outcomes such as compliance with public health safety mandates, personal increased pandemic- hygiene behaviors, and impacts on electoral politics. However, there exists much less work on what influences citizen trust.\nOne such work comes from a 2010 study by Albertson and Gadarian, who manipulated respondent anxiety to see its effects on trust as an outcome variable. The researchers hypothesized that anxiety can increase or decrease citizen trust in different experts, but more specifically, a threat from an external place, far from the government’s jurisdiction, including pandemics, was predicted to lead to increased anxiety that lended itself to increased trust in governmental actors. As outlined in their report on the study, this hypothesis was supported by system justification theory (Jost, 2020), which posits that people cope with negative events by throwing their support behind and faith in existing systems, such as the government and institutions that are widely recognized. At a basic level, this is reasonable, as it is expected that anxious people would look to trusted officials for information in times of crisis and uncertainty.\nAfter establishing this theoretical framework, the researchers tested their hypothesis by comparing participants’ trust in different experts (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, U.S. President, friends in the medical field, and more) between the control group and the treatment group, where respondents were treated with H1N1 (“swine flu”; influenza A virus pandemic in 2009 and 2010) anxiety. Trust in various experts to provide information about the H1N1 pandemic was reported on scales ranging from “not at all” to “a great deal.” For most of the experts the study asked respondents about, the treatment group reported more trust than did the control group. This effect was clear for respected “expert” federal health organizations –– anxiety about the H1N1 virus led respondents to trust the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services more to provide information about H1N1. Interestingly, the treatment did not cause significant increases in trust in public government officials like Barack Obama, perhaps because he was not perceived to have relevant expertise on the public health crisis despite speaking about it multiple times.\nA decade ago, it was intuitive that anxiety about a public health crisis would lead Americans to trust in federal health agencies to provide relevant information about the pandemic more. But as Albertson and Gadarian have aptly pointed out in their 2020 Washington Post analysis of the coronavirus in the United States, COVID-19 is different from H1N1 in that it is heavily politicized and treated as a partisan issue. With partisan divides underpinning Americans’ emotional response to pandemic policies, the pandemic’s effects on anxiety and trust are no longer clear nor intuitive. Do COVID-anxious people place their trust in health experts? Does partisanship shape respondent trust in institutions and experts more than actual anxiety?\nIn this research paper, I aim to analyze the correlative relationship between anxious concern about COVID-19 and trust in different institutions (the CDC, national health advisors, the federal government, and the state government). I also compare this relationship to the relationship between partisanship and the different trust responses to determine if politicization of the pandemic has gone so far as to make party identification more important than concern about the virus in deciding citizens’ trust in important pandemic policymaking institutions.\nHypotheses \\(H_1\\) : Concern about COVID-19 is positively correlated with trust in all four bodies (CDC, national health advisors, federal government, and state government).\n\\(H_2\\) : Partisan identification (as Democrat or Republican) has at least as much predictive power as COVID-19 concern in determining respondent trust in the COVID-19 information sources. \\(H_{2.1}\\) : Respondents who identify as Democrats are more likely to trust the CDC for pandemic information than those who identify as Republicans.\nThe Axios/Ipsos Coronavirus Index To test these hypotheses, Lucy and I used data from the Axios/Ipsos Coronavirus Index, a weekly survey fielded from the Ipsos KnowledgePanel. The Ipsos KnowledgePanel is a longstanding online panel of about 60,000 United States members from diverse populations, including racial minorities, veterans, people with disabilities, adolescents, LGBTQ+ people, gun owners/ households, and more. Specifically, (we) analyzed the data from respondents surveyed from March 13, 2020 to June 28, 2021 from Axios/Ipsos Poll Waves 1 through Wave 48, which had weekly sample sizes of about 1,000 adults.\nEach week, the poll collected responses about Americans’ behaviors, risk perceptions, attitudes about COVID-19. A few questions were of interest to me, regarding (1) COVID-19 concern, (2) trust in the federal government, (3) trust in the state government, (4) trust in the CDC, (5) and trust in national public health officials. These questions were asked as follows:\n“How concerned are you, if at all, about the coronavirus or COVID-19 outbreak?” Extremely concerned (b) Very concerned (c) Somewhat concerned Not very concerned (e) Not at all concerned “How much trust do you have in [the federal government] to provide you with accurate information about coronavirus or COVID-19?” A great deal (b) A fair amount Not very much (d) None at all “How much trust do you have in [your state government] to provide you with accurate information about coronavirus or COVID-19?” Same answer options as above “How much trust do you have in [the Centers for Disease Control, or CDC] to provide you with accurate information about coronavirus or COVID-19?” Same answer options as above “How much trust do you have in [national public health officials] to provide you with accurate information about coronavirus or COVID-19?” Same answer options as above We also used the responses to demographic questions as control variables, including respondent age, education level, gender, income, and party identification.\nWe recoded the COVID concern, trust, and some control variables to make them more readable, where higher values corresponded with higher concern, trust, age, etc. For the party variable, a value of 0 corresponded with Democrats, 1 with Independents, and 2 with Republicans.\nMethods To test \\(H_1\\) , “Concern about COVID-19 is positively correlated with trust in all four bodies (CDC, national health advisors, federal government, and state government),” I ran four linear regression models, each with one of the four trust variables as the outcome variable and dependent variables such as COVID-19 concern, age, education, ethnicity, gender, and party. To show the regression results, I plotted the regression coefficients of each dependent variable for each trust outcome variable. This analytical method and plot combination was chosen for this hypothesis because the linear regression modelling reveals a presence, or lack of, positive correlative relationship between each trust outcome variable and explanatory variables such as COVID concern. The coefficient plot visually demonstrates the relationships between each predictor variable and respondents’ trust, including the effect of COVID concern on trust.\nTo test \\(H_2\\) , “Partisan identification has at least as much predictive power as COVID-19 concern in determining respondent trust in the COVID-19 information sources,” I again ran the four linear regression models. In order to compare the ability of party identification versus COVID concern to explain the variance in trust in different institutions and actors, I used the scale() function to standardize the previously different scales of the explanatory variables. This method is appropriate to test \\(H_2\\) because it allows direct comparison of the regression coefficients associated with COVID concern and party identification. Thus, the variable tied to the larger scaled coefficient can be interpreted as the dependent variable with more predictive power for trust in coronavirus information sources.\nTo test \\(H_{2.1}\\) , “Respondents who identify as Democrats are more likely to trust the CDC than those who identify as Republicans,” I plotted the predicted trust in the CDC for Democrats versus the predicted CDC trust for Republicans using the predict() function. This analytical methodology was chosen because it reveals respondents’ predicted trust in the CDC by party.\nResults For all trust outcomes (trust in the federal government, trust in state governments, trust in the CDC, and trust in national health officials), changes in COVID concern, education, and party were found to have statistically significant effects on trust. The plots below show the regression coefficients of each predictor variable for the trust outcome variables, with 95% confidence intervals around each coefficient estimate.\nThe control variables of gender, ethnicity, and age had near-zero coefficients in each model.\nFigure 1: Predictor Variable Regression Coefficients for Trust For trust in the federal government, the regression coefficient of COVID concern was 0.112, meaning that holding all else constant, an increase of 1 in COVID concern (which is on a scale of 1 through 4) was accompanied by an increase in federal government trust by 0.112 (on a scale of 1 through 4). For the remaining regression model results, an increase of 1 in COVID concern meant: an increase of 0.209 in state government trust, an increase of 0.290 in CDC trust, and an increase of 0.281 in national health official trust. These results from the linear regression models and coefficient plots support \\(H_1\\), as it is shown that across all four measures of trust, concern about COVID-19 is positively (and statistically significantly) correlated with trust. These results are consistent with previous research that examined the relationship between increased anxiety about public health issues and increased trust in health and public officials.\nFigure 1 reveals that party and COVID concern have the regression coefficients of the largest magnitude. Which is more impactful in regards to trust? To directly compare the regression coefficients of COVID concern and party identification as they contribute to changes in trust, the linear regressions were run again, but this time the aforementioned predictor variables were scaled. The previously different scales –– 1 through 4 for concern and 1 through 3 for party –– are now standardized, making the variables’ regression coefficients directly comparable.\nFigure 2: Scaled Regression Coefficients and Trust From Figure 2, which presents the scaled regression coefficients of COVID concern and party alongside other control variable coefficients, it is evident that for each trust measure, COVID concern is tied to a larger scaled coefficient than party ID. The larger coefficient of COVID concern indicates that when on the same scale as party identification, COVID concern affects respondent trust in the different expert sources more than party does. Thus, contrary to \\(H_2\\), COVID concern actually has more predictive power than party identification in determining respondent trust across the information sources. This finding was rather intriguing, as it revealed the truth of a balance that seemed could have tipped either way (towards coronavirus concern or partisan identity); the perceived politicization of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States made it seem plausible that partisanship determined trust in relevant public health officials to an even larger degree than concern about the pandemic itself. Evidently, though partisanship had some effect on trust (as party identification had notably large regression coefficients in relation to the trust outcome variables), it was still trumped by the effect of concern about the pandemic.\nFurther examining the non-negligible relationship between trust in officials about COVID-19 information and partisanship reveals that different party identification is tied to to different levels of predicted trust in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\nFigure 3: Predicted CDC Trust due to COVID Concern, by Party Figure 3 shows the predicted level of trust in the CDC by members of each party as COVID concern rises. Both parties appear to follow the same trend of increased trust in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as COVID concern increases in respondents, but CDC trust begins and ends at higher values for Democrats. \\(H_{2.1}\\) stated that “Respondents who identify as Democrats are more likely to trust the CDC than those who identify as Republicans” and was supported, as Democrats are shown to have higher predicted trust in the CDC than Republicans across all values of COVID concern. This result is somewhat expected, as Democrats have been more worried about containing the coronavirus pandemic and open to the advisory of health advisory such as the works that come from the CDC. Additionally, it is expected that Republicans would have less comparative trust in the CDC due to Donald Trump’s attitudes towards the organization: U.S. President from 2016 to late 2020 and popular amongst Republicans, Trump publicly undercut the credibility of the CDC several times, claiming the organization’s vaccine announcements were “just incorrect information,” calling the Director “confused,” and contradicting the advisory messages put out by the CDC.\nConclusion In recent years, policymakers and health organizations worldwide have been working to end the coronavirus pandemic that began in late 2019. One of the important factors in this effort is citizen trust in public health information. Thus, this paper aimed to analyze the correlative relationship between the increased concern Americans have felt about the pandemic and their trust in different public bodies of information, including in the federal and state government, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and national health advisers. It was hypothesized, and confirmed, that trust was positively correlated with concern across all four measures of trust. Furthermore, it was shown that contrary to the second hypothesis, despite the intense politicization of the COVID-19 pandemic, partisan identity still was not a stronger predictor of trust than actual concern about the pandemic. However, partisanship still had some predictive power for trust in institutions like the CDC, with Democrat respondents being more likely to report higher levels of trust in the CDC than Republicans, confirming the final hypothesis.\nThese hypotheses were tested using linear regression models and prediction models of data from the Axios/Ipsos Coronavirus Index. This study can be extended and improved upon with randomized controlled methodology, so that the causal, rather than correlative, relationship between pandemic anxiety and trust in important information sources can be uncovered.\nThis project makes contributions to the growing body of work on the study of the COVID-19 pandemic, American behaviors in crises, the effect of politicization, and the relationship between anxiety and political behavior and attitudes. The pandemic has been handled by many political actors and thus, attitudes related to pandemic policy and information have some political charge, but individual concern about the pandemic in regards to the wellbeing of loved ones and themselves still remains the most significant factor in determining trust in relevant entities –– citizen trust, which was previously established to be important emotional capital in areas ranging from pandemic containment to electoral politics, has not been perverted by partisanship yet.\nReferences [1] Albertson, \u0026amp; Gadarian, S.

Welcome. This week, my classmates of Government 1372 (Political Psychology) and I worked with our in-class survey results to observe how susceptible we are to cognitive biases and discuss how that may affect our decision-making.\nData Details File Name: Source: These data are from the in-class survey you took last week. Variable Name | Variable Description ——————— | ————————————– | Unique ID for each respondent | From the rare disease problem, the program chosen by the respondent (either ‘Program A’ or ‘Program B’) | From the rare disease problem, the framing condition to which the respondent was assigned (either ‘save’ or ‘die’) | From the Linda problem, the option the respondent thought most probable, either “teller” or “teller and feminist” | From the cab problem, the respondent’s estimate of the probability the car was blue | One of “man”, “woman”, “non-binary”, or “other” | Year at Harvard | Indicator for whether or not the respondent has taken a college-level statistics course\nThe Linda Problem “Linda is 31 years old, single, outspoken, and very bright. She majored in accounting. As a student, she was deeply concerned with issues of women’s rights, and also studied economics.\nWhich is more probable: Linda is a bank teller, or Linda is both a teller and feminist?”\n70.59% of the class answered this question correctly. While the majority of our class was able to choose the right answer, many people in general tend to choose the wrong option. This occurs because many people think that given information about someone, the information makes something more likely about them. When we know that Linda is interested in social activism, we think it is not surprising for her to be a feminist. Most people, however, are not aware of the probability principles of the Linda question – or they simply ignore the principle because the seemingly logical connection between what we know about Linda and what could be true is too convincing in the moment.\nThe Cab Problem That said, the most common response was 0.8.\nExtension So then, what attributes of the respondents might affect how they answered the Linda problem and why?\nI would guess that college statistic education, age, responses to the cab question could correlate to students’ answers to the Linda question.\nTo explore this question, I first examined the crosstable of responses to the Linda question sorted by respondents who had taken a college statistics course versus those who had not.\nLinda x Stats\nFrom this table, we see that students with at least some formal statistics knowledge are more likely to answer the Linda question correctly. 75.9% of statistics students correctly answered that Linda was more likely to be only a teller, while only 61.3% of non-statistics students were able to do so. Despite the non-statistics-student group being much smaller than its counterpart group (31 versus 54 people), both groups contain a similar quantity of students who responded incorrectly – 12 and 13. From these proportions, we can see that respondents who have not taken a college-level statistics course are more likely to use the attribution substitution shortcut to form conclusions about who Linda is. Because the question provides that Linda is outspoken about issues of activism and seems liberal, a heuristic that leads observers to a statistical fallacy – believing that Linda must then be a feminist too – is readily available. Observers don’t actually know if Linda is a feminist, so they substitute the attribute in question with more known ones, such as her activism. However, if observers pay closer attention, their System 2 may remind them of the statistical principle that states “a conjunction of two events can’t be more probable than either of the events occurring by itself.” Of course, previous students of statistics are more likely to remember this principle before allowing their intuitive heuristics to decide Linda’s character for them.\nUnderstanding that students with some statistical background fare better when facing heuristics pitfalls, I wanted to explore the relationship, if any, between responses to the Linda question and responses to the blue cab question. How likely is it that the cab is actually blue? Is Linda a teller with feminist hobbies? These questions are hard to answer with certainty, so do respondents use heuristics to form conclusions about these questions? To look at how these questions’ responses interact, I plotted the Linda responses versus the blue cab responses. I also graphed a vertical line at the actual, statistically correct probability of the identified cab being a blue cab in navy blue, p = 0.41.\nLinda Responses\nFrom this plot, I noticed that those who labeled Linda “teller and feminist” tended to believe that there was a high likelihood that the cab was actually blue. Some respondents who correctly answered the Linda question also thought that the cab was blue, with many responses concentrated over the p = 0.70 mark. However, the “teller” group had many more responses on the lower end of the cab probabilities than the “teller and feminist” group. This indicates to me that the former group perhaps had some intuition that the cab was less likely blue than the question initially would suggest. I then plotted the same data as a bar graph to get another visual.\nLinda x Cab\nThe majority of people who were correctly skeptical of the blue car ID are those at or near the navy vertical line. Those to the left of the vertical line also seem to have reason to believe that the likelihood of the car actually being blue is much closer to the base rate than 0.80, the most common response from our survey. As shown in the segmented bar graph, most of the respondents who were able to show correct or somewhat promising reasoning about the blue cab problem (those at or to the left of the vertical line shown at 0.41) are part of the “teller” group, the same students who answered the Linda question correctly. I believe there is a correlation between the ability of respondents to respond correctly to the Linda problem and the ability of those same respondents to answer the cab question correctly. Because both Linda and the cab are questions that require some statistical knowledge to figure out, the responses to these questions may be related in a way that is worth investigating. Though I do not know how to properly look at the correlation between these responses using R yet, I attempted to observe that using a crosstable of blue-cab-probability-responses versus linda-feminist-status-responses next.\nLinda x Cab 2\nSorting the responses to the cab question into intervals of width 0.10, I observed how often respondents in each interval answered the cab question correctly (T = “teller”) versus incorrectly (TaF = “teller and feminist”). As hypothesized, respondents who were correctly suspicious of the blue ID of the car (so those who answered that the cab was only ~30-50% likely to be blue) were often the same group of people to know that Linda was more likely only a teller. The higher cab guesses, p = 0.8 and up, were more often wrong about Linda. Thus, I conclude that if a respondent ignores the base rate of blue cabs and responds with a higher probability (such as p = 0.8 or p = 0.85), then they are more likely to use attribute substitution to answer the Linda question than respondents who were able to statistically reason their way to the correct estimate for the cab color’s likelihood.\nInvestigating the traits or behaviors of respondents who answer the Linda question correctly or incorrectly was very interesting to me as an initial data exercise. The data gathered from our class survey confirms, especially with the cab problem, that humans are not always able to use our System 2’s and logically reason through confusing questions. What makes respondents more likely to answer the Linda question correctly? After this investigation, I understand that college statistics background has some pull. I also understand now that the respondents’ ability to answer different challenging questions, such as the blue cab one, may indicate their ability to statistically reason and answer our Linda question of interest. Probability and statistics skills are not the most intuitive to most humans, and yet the ability to leverage them has shown to be significant in our class’ responses to seemingly simple survey questions.\nReferences [1] Kahneman (2003)\n","date":"9 September 2021","permalink":"/personal/posts/2021-09-09-decision-making-and-heuristics/","section":"Posts","summary":"Introduction This is the first Data Exploration task of Fall 2021!

Although Blowfish supports multilingual setups, for now, just configure the main language.\nLocate the languages.en.toml file in the config folder. If your main language is English you can use this file as is. Otherwise, rename it so that it includes the correct language code in the filename. For example, for French, rename the file to languages.fr.toml.\nNote that the language code in the language config filename should match the languageCode setting in config.toml. # config/_default/languages.en.toml title = \u0026#34;My awesome website\u0026#34; [author] name = \u0026#34;My name\u0026#34; image = \u0026#34;img/author.jpg\u0026#34; headline = \u0026#34;A generally awesome human\u0026#34; bio = \u0026#34;A little bit about me\u0026#34; links = [ { twitter = \u0026#34;https://twitter.com/username\u0026#34; } ] The [author] configuration determines how the author information is displayed on the website. The image should be placed in the site\u0026rsquo;s assets/ folder. Links will be displayed in the order they are listed.\nIf you need extra detail, further information about each of these configuration options, is covered in the Configuration section.\nColour schemes\u003e Colour schemes # Blowfish ships with a number of colour schemes out of the box. To change the scheme, simply set the colorScheme theme parameter. Valid options are blowfish (default), avocado, fire, ocean and slate.\n# config/_default/params.toml colorScheme = \u0026#34;blowfish\u0026#34; Blowfish defines a three-colour palette that is used throughout the theme. Each main colour contains ten shades which are based upon the colours that are included in Tailwind.\nBlowfish (default)\u003e Blowfish (default) # Avocado\u003e Avocado # Fire\u003e Fire # Forest\u003e Forest # Princess\u003e Princess # Neon\u003e Neon # Bloody\u003e Bloody # Terminal\u003e Terminal # Marvel\u003e Marvel # Noir\u003e Noir # Autumn\u003e Autumn # Congo\u003e Congo # Slate\u003e Slate # Although these are the default schemes, you can also create your own. Refer to the Advanced Customisation section for details.\nOrganising content\u003e Organising content # By default, Blowfish doesn\u0026rsquo;t force you to use a particular content type. In doing so you are free to define your content as you wish. You might prefer pages for a static site, posts for a blog, or projects for a portfolio.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s a quick overview of a basic Blowfish project. All content is placed within the content folder:\n. ├── assets │ └── img │ └── author.jpg ├── config │ └── _default ├── content │ ├── _index.md │ ├── about.md │ └── posts │ ├── _index.md │ ├── first-post.md │ └── another-post │ ├── aardvark.jpg │ └── index.md └── themes └── blowfish It\u0026rsquo;s important to have a firm grasp of how Hugo expects content to be organised as the theme is designed to take full advantage of Hugo page bundles. Be sure to read the official Hugo docs for more information.\nBlowfish is also flexible when it comes to taxonomies. Some people prefer to use tags and categories to group their content, others prefer to use topics.\nHugo defaults to using posts, tags and categories out of the box and this will work fine if that\u0026rsquo;s what you want. If you wish to customise this, however, you can do so by creating a taxonomies.toml configuration file:\n# config/_default/taxonomies.toml topic = \u0026#34;topics\u0026#34; This will replace the default tags and categories with topics. Refer to the Hugo Taxonomy docs for more information on naming taxonomies.\nWhen you create a new taxonomy, you will need to adjust the navigation links on the website to point to the correct sections, which is covered below.\nMenus\u003e Menus # Blowfish has two menus that can be customised to suit the content and layout of your site. The main menu appears in the site header and the footer menu appears at the bottom of the page just above the copyright notice.\nBoth menus are configured in the menus.en.toml file. Similarly to the languages config file, if you wish to use another language, rename this file and replace en with the language code you wish to use.\n# config/_default/menus.toml [[main]] name = \u0026#34;Blog\u0026#34; pageRef = \u0026#34;posts\u0026#34; weight = 10 [[main]] name = \u0026#34;Topics\u0026#34; pageRef = \u0026#34;topics\u0026#34; weight = 20 [[main]] pre = \u0026#34;github\u0026#34; name = \u0026#34;GitHub\u0026#34; url = \u0026#34;https://github.com/nunocoracao/blowfish\u0026#34; weight = 30 [[main]] identifier = \u0026#34;github2\u0026#34; pre = \u0026#34;github\u0026#34; url = \u0026#34;https://github.com/nunocoracao/blowfish\u0026#34; weight = 40 [[footer]] name = \u0026#34;Privacy\u0026#34; url = \u0026#34;https://external-link\u0026#34; The name parameter specifies the text that is used in the menu link. You can also optionally provide a title which fills the HTML title attribute for the link.\nThe pageRef parameter allows you to easily reference Hugo content pages and taxonomies. It is the quickest way to configure the menu as you can simply refer to any Hugo content item and it will automatically build the correct link. To link to external URLs, the url parameter can be used.\nThe pre parameter allows you to place an icon from Blowfish\u0026rsquo;s icon set on the menu entry. This parameter can be used with name parameter or by itself. If you want to use multiple menu entries with just icons please set the identifierparameter otherwise Hugo will default to the naming tag as the id and probably not display all the menu entries.\nMenu links will be sorted from lowest to highest weight, and then alphabetically by name.\nBoth menus are completely optional and can be commented out if not required. Use the template provided in the file as a guide.\nThumbnails \u0026amp; Backgrounds\u003e Thumbnails \u0026amp; Backgrounds # Blowfish was built so it would be easy to add visual support to your articles. If your familiar with Hugo article strucutre, you just need to place an image file (almost all formats are supported bue we recommend .png or .jpg) that starts with feature* inside your article folder. And that\u0026rsquo;s it, Blowfish will then able to both use the image as a thumbnail within your website as well as for oEmbed cards across social platforms.\nHere is also a guide with more info and a sample if you want to see how you can do it.\nAdditionally, Blowfish also supports background hero images in articles and lists. In order to use a different image than the featured one, add an image file in which the name starts with background*.\nDetailed configuration\u003e Detailed configuration # The steps above are the bare minimum configuration.

Feel free to convert your config to YAML or JSON if you wish.\nThe default theme configuration is documented in each file so you can freely adjust the settings to meet your needs.\nAs outlined in the installation instructions, you should adjust your theme configuration by modifying the files in the config/_default/ folder of your Hugo project and delete the config.toml file in your project root. Site configuration\u003e Site configuration # Standard Hugo configuration variables are respected throughout the theme, however there are some specific things that should be configured for the best experience.\nThe site configuration is managed through the config/_default/config.toml file. The table below outlines all the settings that the Blowfish takes advantage of.\nNote that the variable names provided in this table use dot notation to simplify the TOML data structure (ie. outputs.home refers to [outputs] home).\nName Default Description theme \u0026quot;blowfish\u0026quot; When using Hugo Modules this config value should be removed. For all other installation types, this must be set to blowfish for the theme to function. baseURL Not set The URL to the root of the website. defaultContentLanguage \u0026quot;en\u0026quot; This value determines the default language of theme components and content. Refer to the language and i18n section below for supported language codes. enableRobotsTXT true When enabled, a robots.txt file will be created in the site root that allows search engines to crawl the entire site. If you prefer to provide your own pre-made robots.txt, set to false and place your file in the static directory. For complete control, you may provide a custom layout to generate this file. paginate 10 The number of articles listed on each page of the article listing. summaryLength 0 The number of words that are used to generate the article summary when one is not provided in the front matter. A value of 0 will use the first sentence. This value has no effect when summaries are hidden. outputs.home [\u0026quot;HTML\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;RSS\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;JSON\u0026quot;] The output formats that are generated for the site. Blowfish requires HTML, RSS and JSON for all theme components to work correctly. permalinks Not set Refer to the Hugo docs for permalink configuration. taxonomies Not set Refer to the Organising content section for taxonomy configuration. Thumbnails\u003e Thumbnails # Blowfish was built so it would be easy to add visual support to your articles. If your familiar with Hugo article strucutre, you just need to place an image file (almost all formats are supported bue we recommend .png or .jpg) that starts with feature* inside your article folder. And that\u0026rsquo;s it, Blowfish will then able to both use the image as a thumbnail within your website as well as for oEmbed cards across social platforms.\nHere is also a guide with more info and a sample if you want to see how you can do it.\nLanguage and i18n\u003e Language and i18n # Blowfish is optimised for full multilingual websites and theme assets are translated into several languages out of the box. The language configuration allows you to generate multiple versions of your content to provide a customised experience to your visitors in their native language.\nThe theme currently supports the following languages by default:\nLanguage Code 🇬🇧 English en 🇧🇩 Bengali bn 🇨🇳 Simplified Chinese (China) zh-cn 🇹🇼 Traditional Chinese (Taiwan) zh-tw 🇫🇮 Finnish fi 🇫🇷 French fr 🇩🇪 German de 🇮🇱 Hebrew he 🇭🇺 Hungarian hu 🇮🇹 Italian it 🇯🇵 Japanese ja 🇧🇷 Portuguese (Brazil) pt-br 🇵🇹 Portuguese (Portugal) pt-pt 🇵🇱 Polish pl 🇷🇴 Romanian ro 🇪🇸 Spanish (Spain) es 🇹🇷 Turkish tr 🇭🇷 Croatian hr 🇮🇩 Indonesian id The default translations can be overridden by creating a custom file in i18n/[code].yaml that contains the translation strings. You can also use this method to add new languages. If you\u0026rsquo;d like to share a new translation with the community, please open a pull request.\nConfiguration\u003e Configuration # In order to be as flexible as possible, a language configuration file needs to be created for each language on the website. By default Blowfish includes an English language configuration at config/_default/languages.en.toml.\nThe default file can be used as a template to create additional languages, or renamed if you wish to author your website in a language other than English. Simply name the file using the format languages.[language-code].toml.\nNote: Ensure the defaultContentLanguage parameter in the site configuration matches the language code in your language config filename. Name Default Description languageCode \u0026quot;en\u0026quot; The Hugo language code for this file. It can be a top-level language (ie. en) or a sub-variant (ie. en-au) and should match the language code in the filename. Hugo expects this value to always be in lowercase. For proper HTML compliance, set the isoCode parameter which is case-sensitive. languageName \u0026quot;English\u0026quot; The name of the language. displayName \u0026quot;EN\u0026quot; The name used when the language appears on the website. isoCode \u0026quot;en\u0026quot; The ISO language code for HTML metadata purposes.

Custom links can be added by providing corresponding SVG icon assets in assets/icons/. Menus\u003e Menus # Blowfish also supports language-specific menu configurations. Menu config files follow the same naming format as the languages file. Simply provide the language code in the file name to tell Hugo which language the file relates to.\nMenu config files are named with the format menus.[language-code].toml. Always ensure that the language code used in the menus configuration matches the languages configuration.\nThe Getting Started section explains more about the structure of this file. You can also refer to the Hugo menu docs for more configuration examples.\nTheme parameters\u003e Theme parameters # Blowfish provides a large number of configuration parameters that control how the theme functions.

If a static asset or URL to an external image is provided, it will be included as-is without any image processing by Hugo.\nThe figure shortcode accepts six parameters:\nParameter Description src Required. The local path/filename or URL of the image. When providing a path and filename, the theme will attempt to locate the image using the following lookup order: Firstly, as a page resource bundled with the page; then an asset in the assets/ directory; then finally, a static image in the static/ directory. alt Alternative text description for the image. caption Markdown for the image caption, which will be displayed below the image. class Additional CSS classes to apply to the image. href URL that the image should be linked to. default Special parameter to revert to default Hugo figure behaviour. Simply provide default=true and then use normal Hugo shortcode syntax. Blowfish also supports automatic conversion of images included using standard Markdown syntax. Simply use the following format and the theme will handle the rest:\n![Alt text](image.jpg \u0026#34;Image caption\u0026#34;) Example:\n{{\u0026lt; figure src=\u0026#34;abstract.jpg\u0026#34; alt=\u0026#34;Abstract purple artwork\u0026#34; caption=\u0026#34;Photo by [Jr Korpa](https://unsplash.com/@jrkorpa) on [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/)\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}} \u0026lt;!-- OR --\u0026gt; ![Abstract purple artwork](abstract.jpg \u0026#34;Photo by [Jr Korpa](https://unsplash.com/@jrkorpa) on [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/)\u0026#34;) Photo by Jr Korpa on Unsplash Icon\u003e Icon # icon outputs an SVG icon and takes the icon name as its only parameter.

Check the icon samples page for a full list of supported icons.\nCustom icons can be added by providing your own icon assets in the assets/icons/ directory of your project. The icon can then be referenced in the shortcode by using the SVG filename without the .svg extension.\nIcons can also be used in partials by calling the icon partial.\nList\u003e List # List will display a list of recent articles. This shortcode requires a limit value to constraint the list. Additionally, it supports a where and a value in order to filter articles by their parameters. Note that this shortcode will not display its parent page but it will count for the limit value.\nParameter Description limit Required. the number of recent articles to display. where the number of recent articles to display. value the number of recent articles to display.

Refer to the online reference of supported TeX functions for the available syntax.\nTo include mathematical expressions in an article, simply place the shortcode anywhere with the content. It only needs to be included once per article and KaTeX will automatically render any markup on that page. Both inline and block notation are supported.\nInline notation can be generated by wrapping the expression in \\\\( and \\\\) delimiters. Alternatively, block notation can be generated using $$ delimiters.\nExample:\n{{\u0026lt; katex \u0026gt;}} \\\\(f(a,b,c) = (a^2+b^2+c^2)^3\\\\) \\(f(a,b,c) = (a^2+b^2+c^2)^3\\)\nCheck out the mathematical notation samples page for more examples.\nLead\u003e Lead # lead is used to bring emphasis to the start of an article. It can be used to style an introduction, or to call out an important piece of information. Simply wrap any Markdown content in the lead shortcode.\nExample:\n{{\u0026lt; lead \u0026gt;}} When life gives you lemons, make lemonade. {{\u0026lt; /lead \u0026gt;}} When life gives you lemons, make lemonade. Mermaid\u003e Mermaid # mermaid allows you to draw detailed diagrams and visualisations using text. It uses Mermaid under the hood and supports a wide variety of diagrams, charts and other output formats.\nSimply write your Mermaid syntax within the mermaid shortcode and let the plugin do the rest.\nRefer to the official Mermaid docs for details on syntax and supported diagram types.\nExample:\n{{\u0026lt; mermaid \u0026gt;}} graph LR; A[Lemons]--\u0026gt;B[Lemonade]; B--\u0026gt;C[Profit] {{\u0026lt; /mermaid \u0026gt;}} graph LR; A[Lemons]--\u003eB[Lemonade]; B--\u003eC[Profit] You can see some additional Mermaid examples on the diagrams and flowcharts samples page.\n","date":"11 August 2020","permalink":"/personal/docs/shortcodes/","section":"Documentation","summary":"In addition to all the default Hugo shortcodes, Blowfish adds a few extras for additional functionality.\nAlert\u003e Alert # alert outputs its contents as a stylised message box within your article.","title":"Shortcodes"},{"content":"","date":"10 August 2020","permalink":"/personal/tags/analytics/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"analytics"},{"content":"","date":"10 August 2020","permalink":"/personal/tags/comments/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"comments"},{"content":"","date":"10 August 2020","permalink":"/personal/tags/favicons/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"favicons"},{"content":"Some websites have more than one author contributing with content and therefore require more than a single default author across the entire website.

In the example below, we reference the author created in the previous step using its key.\nThis will render an extra author using the data provided in the json file. This feature does not change in any way the default author configured for the overall site, and therefore, you can control both separately. Using the showAuthor parameter, you can configure whether to show the default author, that is the normal use-case for a single author blog. The new authors front-matter parameter allows you to define authors specifically to an article, and they will be rendered independently of the configurations for the default site author.\n--- title: \u0026#34;Multiple Authors\u0026#34; date: 2020-08-10 draft: false description: \u0026#34;Configure multiple authors for your articles.\u0026#34; slug: \u0026#34;multi-author\u0026#34; tags: [\u0026#34;authors\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;config\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;docs\u0026#34;] showAuthor: true authors: - \u0026#34;nunocoracao\u0026#34; showAuthorsBadges : false --- In the example, which matches the markdown of the current page, both the default author and the new one will be displayed. You can scroll now to see the outcome.\nCreate the Authors Taxonomy\u003e Create the Authors Taxonomy # To get lists of articles for each of your authors you can configure the authors taxonomy, which opens up some more configurations that might be interesting. This is an optional step in the process that is not required to display the authors in your articles.\nFirst step is to configure the authors taxonomy in your config.toml file, like in the example below. Even though tag and category are defined by default with Hugo, once you add a specific taxonomies section you need to add them again otherwise the site will not process them.\n[taxonomies] tag = \u0026#34;tags\u0026#34; category = \u0026#34;categories\u0026#34; author = \u0026#34;authors\u0026#34; And that’s just about it. Now you will have pages that reference your authors and, for each, show the respective list of articles where they participate. You can also use the article.showAuthorsBadges on the config file, or showAuthorsBadges on each article to chose whether to display the authors taxonomy as badges in each post item. As an example, this doc is configured to not display authors but if you look at the sample referenced below you will see the authors displayed as badges.\nLastly, you can add more detail to each author page so that it displays a little bio, links, or whatever information fits your use-case. To achieve that, create a folder with the key to each author inside ./content/authors and inside each folder place a _index.md file. For the example above, we would end up with a .content/authors/nunocoracao/_index.md file. Inside, you can configure the actual name of the author and the contents of their page. Authors in this documentation website are configured like this, so you can have a look by playing around with the site.\n--- title: \u0026#34;Nuno Coração\u0026#34; --- Nuno\u0026#39;s awesome dummy bio.

This page is designed to pull everything together and offer some worked examples that you might like to use in your Hugo project.\nTip: If you\u0026rsquo;re new to Hugo, be sure to check out the official docs to learn more about the concept of page bundles and resources. The examples on this page can all be adapted to different scenarios but hopefully give you some ideas about how to approach formatting a particular content item for your individual project.\nBranch pages\u003e Branch pages # Branch page bundles in Hugo cover items like the homepage, section listings, and taxonomy pages. The important thing to remember about branch bundles is that the filename for this content type is _index.md.\nBlowfish will honour the front matter parameters specified in branch pages and these will override the default settings for that particular page. For example, setting the title parameter in a branch page will allow overriding the page title.\nHomepage\u003e Homepage # Layout: layouts/index.html Content: content/_index.md The homepage in Blowfish is special in that it\u0026rsquo;s overarching design is controlled by the homepage layout config parameter. You can learn more about this in the Homepage Layout section.\nIf you want to add custom content to this page, you simply need to create a content/_index.md file. Anything in this file will then be included in your homepage.\nExample:\n--- title: \u0026#34;Welcome to Blowfish!\u0026#34; description: \u0026#34;This is a demo of adding content to the homepage.\u0026#34; --- Welcome to my website! I\u0026#39;m really happy you stopped by. This example sets a custom title and adds some additional text to the body of the page. Any Markdown formatted text is acceptable, including shortcodes, images and links.\nList pages\u003e List pages # Layout: layouts/_default/list.html Content: content/../_index.md List pages group all the pages within into a section and provide a way for visitors to reach each page. A blog or portfolio are examples of a list page as they group together posts or projects.\nCreating a list page is as simple as making a sub-directory in the content folder. For example, to create a \u0026ldquo;Projects\u0026rdquo; section, you would create content/projects/. Then create a Markdown file for each of your projects.\nA list page will be generated by default, however to customise the content, you should also create an _index.md page in this new directory.\n. └── content └── projects ├── _index.md # /projects ├── first-project.md # /projects/first-project └── another-project ├── index.md # /projects/another-project └── project.jpg Hugo will generate URLs for the pages in your projects folder accordingly.\nJust like the homepage, content in the _index.md file will be output into the generated list index. Blowfish will then list any pages in this section below the content.\nExample:\n--- title: \u0026#34;Projects\u0026#34; description: \u0026#34;Learn about some of my projects.\u0026#34; cascade: showReadingTime: false --- This section contains all my current projects. In this example, the special cascade parameter is being used to hide the reading time on any sub-pages within this section. By doing this, any project pages will not have their reading time showing. This is a great way to override default theme parameters for an entire section without having to include them in every individual page.\nThe samples section of this site is an example of a list page.\nTaxonomy pages\u003e Taxonomy pages # List layout: layouts/_default/taxonomy.html Term layout: layouts/_default/term.html Content: content/../_index.md Taxonomy pages come in two forms - taxonomy lists and taxonomy terms. Lists display a listing of each of the terms within a given taxonomy, while terms display a list of pages that are related to a given term.\nThe terminology can get a little confusing so let\u0026rsquo;s explore an example using a taxonomy named animals.\nFirstly, to use taxonomies in Hugo, they have to be configured. This is done by creating a config file at config/_default/taxonomies.toml and defining the taxonomy name.\n# config/_default/taxonomies.toml animal = \u0026#34;animals\u0026#34; Hugo expects taxonomies to be listed using their singular and plural forms, so we add the singular animal equals the plural animals to create our example taxonomy.\nNow that our animals taxonomy exists, it needs to be added to individual content items. It\u0026rsquo;s as simple as inserting it into the front matter:\n--- title: \u0026#34;Into the Lion\u0026#39;s Den\u0026#34; description: \u0026#34;This week we\u0026#39;re learning about lions.\u0026#34; animals: [\u0026#34;lion\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;cat\u0026#34;] --- This has now created two terms within our animals taxonomy - lion and cat.\nAlthough it\u0026rsquo;s not obvious at this point, Hugo will now be generating list and term pages for this new taxonomy. By default the listing can be accessed at /animals/ and the term pages can be found at /animals/lion/ and /animals/cat/.\nThe list page will list all the terms contained within the taxonomy. In this example, navigating to /animals/ will show a page that has links for \u0026ldquo;lion\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;cat\u0026rdquo; which take visitors to the individual term pages.\nThe term pages will list all the pages contained within that term. These term lists are essentially the same as normal list pages and behave in much the same way.\nIn order to add custom content to taxonomy pages, simply create _index.md files in the content folder using the taxonomy name as the sub-directory name.\n. └── content └── animals ├── _index.md # /animals └── lion └── _index.md # /animals/lion Anything in these content files will now be placed onto the generated taxonomy pages. As with other content, the front matter variables can be used to override defaults. In this way you could have a tag named lion but override the title to be \u0026ldquo;Lion\u0026rdquo;.\nTo see how this looks in reality, check out the tags taxonomy listing on this site.\nLeaf pages\u003e Leaf pages # Layout: layouts/_default/single.html Content (standalone): content/../page-name.md Content (bundled): content/../page-name/index.md Leaf pages in Hugo are basically standard content pages. They are defined as pages that don\u0026rsquo;t contain any sub-pages. These could be things like an about page, or an individual blog post that lives in the blog section of the website.\nThe most important thing to remember about leaf pages is that unlike branch pages, leaf pages should be named index.md without an underscore. Leaf pages are also special in that they can be grouped together at the top level of the section and named with a unique name.\n. └── content └── blog ├── first-post.md # /blog/first-post ├── second-post.md # /blog/second-post └── third-post ├── index.md # /blog/third-post └── image.jpg When including assets in a page, like an image, a page bundle should be used. Page bundles are created using a sub-directory with an index.md file. Grouping the assets with the content in its own directory is important as many of the shortcodes and other theme logic assumes that resources are bundled alongside pages.\nExample:\n--- title: \u0026#34;My First Blog Post\u0026#34; date: 2022-01-25 description: \u0026#34;Welcome to my blog!\u0026#34; summary: \u0026#34;Learn more about me and why I am starting this blog.\u0026#34; tags: [\u0026#34;welcome\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;new\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;about\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;first\u0026#34;] --- _This_ is the content of my blog post. Leaf pages have a wide variety of front matter parameters that can be used to customise how they are displayed.\nExternal links\u003e External links # Blowfish has a special feature that allows links to external pages to appear alongside articles in the article listings. This is useful if you have content on third party websites like Medium, or research papers that you\u0026rsquo;d like to link to, without replicating the content in your Hugo site.\nIn order to create an external link article, some special front matter needs to be set:\n--- title: \u0026#34;My Medium post\u0026#34; date: 2022-01-25 externalUrl: \u0026#34;https://medium.com/\u0026#34; summary: \u0026#34;I wrote a post on Medium.\u0026#34; showReadingTime: false _build: render: \u0026#34;false\u0026#34; list: \u0026#34;local\u0026#34; --- Along with the normal front matter parameters like title and summary, the externalUrl parameter is used to tell Blowfish that this is not an ordinary article. The URL provided here will be where visitors are directed when they select this article.\nAdditionally, we use a special Hugo front matter parameter _build to prevent a normal page for this content being generated - there\u0026rsquo;s no point generating a page since we\u0026rsquo;re linking to an external URL!\nThe theme includes an archetype to make generating these external link articles simple. Just specify -k external when making new content.\nhugo new -k external posts/my-post.md Simple pages\u003e Simple pages # Layout: layouts/_default/simple.html Front Matter: layout: \u0026quot;simple\u0026quot; Blowfish also includes a special layout for simple pages. The simple layout is a full-width template that just places Markdown content into the page without any special theme features.\nThe only features available in the simple layout are breadcrumbs and sharing links. However, the behaviour of these can still be controlled using the normal page front matter variables.\nTo enable the simple layout on a particular page, add the layout front matter variable with a value of \u0026quot;simple\u0026quot;:\n--- title: \u0026#34;My landing page\u0026#34; date: 2022-03-08 layout: \u0026#34;simple\u0026#34; --- This page content is now full-width. Custom layouts\u003e Custom layouts # One of the benefits of Hugo is that it makes it easy to create custom layouts for the whole site, individual sections or pages.\nLayouts follow all the normal Hugo templating rules and more information is available in the official Hugo docs.\nOverriding default layouts\u003e Overriding default layouts # Each of the content types discussed above lists the layout file that is used to generate each type of page. If this file is created in your local project it will override the theme template and thus can be used to customise the default style of the website.\nFor example, creating a layouts/_default/single.html file will allow the layout of leaf pages to be completely customised.\nCustom section layouts\u003e Custom section layouts # It is also simple to create custom layouts for individual content sections. This is useful when you want to make a section that lists a certain type of content using a particular style.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s step through an example that creates a custom \u0026ldquo;Projects\u0026rdquo; page that lists projects using a special layout.\nIn order to do this, structure your content using the normal Hugo content rules and create a section for your projects. Additionally, create a new layout for the projects section by using the same directory name as the content and adding a list.html file.\n. └── content │ └── projects │ ├── _index.md │ ├── first-project.md │ └── second-project.md └── layouts └── projects └── list.html This list.html file will now override the default list template, but only for the projects section. Before we look at this file, lets first look at the individual project files.\n--- title: \u0026#34;Blowfish\u0026#34; date: 2021-08-11 icon: \u0026#34;github\u0026#34; description: \u0026#34;A theme for Hugo built with Tailwind CSS.\u0026#34; topics: [\u0026#34;Hugo\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Web\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Tailwind\u0026#34;] externalUrl: \u0026#34;https://github.com/nunocoracao/blowfish/\u0026#34; --- In this example we are assigning some metadata for each project that we can then use in our list template. There\u0026rsquo;s no page content, but there\u0026rsquo;s nothing stopping you from including it. It\u0026rsquo;s your own custom template after all!\nWith the projects defined, now we can create a list template that outputs the details of each project.\n{{ define \u0026#34;main\u0026#34; }} \u0026lt;section class=\u0026#34;mt-8\u0026#34;\u0026gt; {{ range .Pages }} \u0026lt;article class=\u0026#34;pb-6\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;a class=\u0026#34;flex\u0026#34; href=\u0026#34;{{ .Params.externalUrl }}\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;div class=\u0026#34;mr-3 text-3xl text-neutral-300\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;span class=\u0026#34;relative inline-block align-text-bottom\u0026#34;\u0026gt; {{ partial \u0026#34;icon.html\u0026#34; .Params.icon }} \u0026lt;/span\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;h3 class=\u0026#34;flex text-xl font-semibold\u0026#34;\u0026gt; {{ .Title }} \u0026lt;/h3\u0026gt; \u0026lt;p class=\u0026#34;text-sm text-neutral-400\u0026#34;\u0026gt; {{ .Description }} \u0026lt;/p\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/a\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/article\u0026gt; {{ end }} \u0026lt;/section\u0026gt; {{ end }} Although this is quite a straightforward example, you can see that it steps through each of the pages in this section (ie. each project), and then outputs HTML links to each project alongside an icon. The metadata in the front matter for each project is used to determine which information is displayed.\nKeep in mind that you\u0026rsquo;ll need to ensure the relevant styles and classes are available, which may require the Tailwind CSS to be recompiled. This is discussed in more detail in the Advanced Customisation section.\nWhen making custom templates like this one, it\u0026rsquo;s always easiest to take a look at how the default Blowfish template works and then use that as a guide. Remember, the Hugo docs are a great resource to learn more about creating templates too.\n","date":"9 August 2020","permalink":"/personal/docs/content-examples/","section":"Documentation","summary":"If you\u0026rsquo;ve been reading the documentation in order, you should now know about all the features and configurations available in Blowfish.

Read below to learn more about what can be customised and the best way of achieving your desired result.\nIf you need further advice, post your questions on GitHub Discussions.\nHugo project structure\u003e Hugo project structure # Before leaping into it, first a quick note about Hugo project structure and best practices for managing your content and theme customisations.\nIn summary: Never directly edit the theme files. Only make customisations in your Hugo project\u0026rsquo;s sub-directories, not in the themes directory itself. Blowfish is built to take advantage of all the standard Hugo practices. It is designed to allow all aspects of the theme to be customised and overriden without changing any of the core theme files. This allows for a seamless upgrade experience while giving you total control over the look and feel of your website.\nIn order to achieve this, you should never manually adjust any of the theme files directly. Whether you install using Hugo modules, as a git submodule or manually include the theme in your themes/ directory, you should always leave these files intact.\nThe correct way to adjust any theme behaviour is by overriding files using Hugo\u0026rsquo;s powerful file lookup order. In summary, the lookup order ensures any files you include in your project directory will automatically take precedence over any theme files.\nFor example, if you wanted to override the main article template in Blowfish, you can simply create your own layouts/_default/single.html file and place it in the root of your project. This file will then override the single.html from the theme without ever changing the theme itself. This works for any theme files - HTML templates, partials, shortcodes, config files, data, assets, etc.\nAs long as you follow this simple practice, you will always be able to update the theme (or test different theme versions) without worrying that you will lose any of your custom changes.\nColour schemes\u003e Colour schemes # Blowfish ships with a number of colour schemes out of the box. To change the basic colour scheme, you can set the colorScheme theme parameter. Refer to the Getting Started section to learn more about the built-in schemes.\nIn addition to the default schemes, you can also create your own and re-style the entire website to your liking. Schemes are created by by placing a \u0026lt;scheme-name\u0026gt;.css file in the assets/css/schemes/ folder. Once the file is created, simply refer to it by name in the theme configuration.\nBlowfish defines a three-colour palette that is used throughout the theme. The three colours are defined as neutral, primary and secondary variants, each containing ten shades of colour.\nDue to the way Tailwind CSS 3.0 calculates colour values with opacity, the colours specified in the scheme need to conform to a particular format by providing the red, green and blue colour values.\n:root { --color-primary-500: 139, 92, 246; } This example defines a CSS variable for the primary-500 colour with a red value of 139, green value of 92 and blue value of 246.\nUse one of the existing theme stylesheets as a template. You are free to define your own colours, but for some inspiration, check out the official Tailwind colour palette reference.\nOverriding the stylesheet\u003e Overriding the stylesheet # Sometimes you need to add a custom style to style your own HTML elements. Blowfish provides for this scenario by allowing you to override the default styles in your own CSS stylesheet. Simply create a custom.css file in your project\u0026rsquo;s assets/css/ folder.\nThe custom.css file will be minified by Hugo and loaded automatically after all the other theme styles which means anything in your custom file will take precedence over the defaults.\nUsing additional fonts\u003e Using additional fonts # Blowfish allows you to easily change the font for your site. After creating a custom.css file in your project\u0026rsquo;s assets/css/ folder, place you font file inside a fonts folder withing the static root folder.\n. ├── assets │ └── css │ └── custom.css ... └─── static └── fonts └─── font.ttf This makes the font available to the website. Now, the font can just import it in your custom.css and replaced wherever you see fit. The example below shows what replacing the font for the entire html would look like.\n@font-face { font-family: font; src: url(\u0026#39;/fonts/font.ttf\u0026#39;); } html { font-family: font; } Adjusting the font size\u003e Adjusting the font size # Changing the font size of your website is one example of overriding the default stylesheet. Blowfish makes this simple as it uses scaled font sizes throughout the theme which are derived from the base HTML font size. By default, Tailwind sets the default size to 12pt, but it can be changed to whatever value you prefer.\nCreate a custom.css file using the instructions above and add the following CSS declaration:\n/* Increase the default font size */ html { font-size: 13pt; } Simply by changing this one value, all the font sizes on your website will be adjusted to match this new size. Therefore, to increase the overall font sizes used, make the value greater than 12pt. Similarly, to decrease the font sizes, make the value less than 12pt.\nBuilding the theme CSS from source\u003e Building the theme CSS from source # If you\u0026rsquo;d like to make a major change, you can take advantage of Tailwind CSS\u0026rsquo;s JIT compiler and rebuild the entire theme CSS from scratch. This is useful if you want to adjust the Tailwind configuration or add extra Tailwind classes to the main stylesheet.\nNote: Building the theme manually is intended for advanced users. Let\u0026rsquo;s step through how building the Tailwind CSS works.\nTailwind configuration\u003e Tailwind configuration # In order to generate a CSS file that only contains the Tailwind classes that are actually being used the JIT compiler needs to scan through all the HTML templates and Markdown content files to check which styles are present in the markup. The compiler does this by looking at the tailwind.config.js file which is included in the root of the theme directory:\n// themes/blowfish/tailwind.config.js module.exports = { content: [ \u0026#34;./layouts/**/*.html\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;./content/**/*.{html,md}\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;./themes/blowfish/layouts/**/*.html\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;./themes/blowfish/content/**/*.{html,md}\u0026#34;, ], // and more... }; This default configuration has been included with these content paths so that you can easily generate your own CSS file without needing to modify it, provided you follow a particular project structure. Namely, you have to include Blowfish in your project as a subdirectory at themes/blowfish/. This means you cannot easily use Hugo Modules to install the theme and you must go down either the git submodule (recommended) or manual install routes. The Installation docs explain how to install the theme using either of these methods.\nProject structure\u003e Project structure # In order to take advantage of the default configuration, your project should look something like this\u0026hellip;\n. ├── assets │ └── css │ └── compiled │ └── main.css # this is the file we will generate ├── config # site config │ └── _default ├── content # site content │ ├── _index.md │ ├── projects │ │ └── _index.md │ └── blog │ └── _index.md ├── layouts # custom layouts for your site │ ├── partials │ │ └── extend-article-link.html │ ├── projects │ │ └── list.html │ └── shortcodes │ └── disclaimer.html └── themes └── blowfish # git submodule or manual theme install This example structure adds a new projects content type with its own custom layout along with a custom shortcode and extended partial. Provided the project follows this structure, all that\u0026rsquo;s required is to recompile the main.css file.\nInstall dependencies\u003e Install dependencies # In order for this to work you\u0026rsquo;ll need to change into the themes/blowfish/ directory and install the project dependencies. You\u0026rsquo;ll need npm on your local machine for this step.\ncd themes/blowfish npm install Run the Tailwind compiler\u003e Run the Tailwind compiler # With the dependencies installed all that\u0026rsquo;s left is to use Tailwind CLI to invoke the JIT compiler. Navigate back to the root of your Hugo project and issue the following command:\ncd ../.. ./themes/blowfish/node_modules/tailwindcss/lib/cli.js -c ./themes/blowfish/tailwind.config.js -i ./themes/blowfish/assets/css/main.css -o ./assets/css/compiled/main.css --jit It\u0026rsquo;s a bit of an ugly command due to the paths involved but essentially you\u0026rsquo;re calling Tailwind CLI and passing it the location of the Tailwind config file (the one we looked at above), where to find the theme\u0026rsquo;s main.css file and then where you want the compiled CSS file to be placed (it\u0026rsquo;s going into the assets/css/compiled/ folder of your Hugo project).\nThe config file will automatically inspect all the content and layouts in your project as well as all those in the theme and build a new CSS file that contains all the CSS required for your website. Due to the way Hugo handles file hierarchy, this file in your project will now automatically override the one that comes with the theme.\nEach time you make a change to your layouts and need new Tailwind CSS styles, you can simply re-run the command and generate the new CSS file. You can also add -w to the end of the command to run the JIT compiler in watch mode.\nMake a build script\u003e Make a build script # To fully complete this solution, you can simplify this whole process by adding aliases for these commands, or do what I do and add a package.json to the root of your project which contains the necessary scripts\u0026hellip;\n// package.json { \u0026#34;name\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;my-website\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;version\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;1.0.0\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;description\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;scripts\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;server\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;hugo server -b http://localhost -p 8000\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;dev\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;NODE_ENV=development ./themes/blowfish/node_modules/tailwindcss/lib/cli.js -c ./themes/blowfish/tailwind.config.js -i ./themes/blowfish/assets/css/main.css -o ./assets/css/compiled/main.css --jit -w\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;build\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;NODE_ENV=production ./themes/blowfish/node_modules/tailwindcss/lib/cli.js -c ./themes/blowfish/tailwind.config.js -i ./themes/blowfish/assets/css/main.css -o ./assets/css/compiled/main.css --jit\u0026#34; }, // and more... } Now when you want to work on designing your site, you can invoke npm run dev and the compiler will run in watch mode. When you\u0026rsquo;re ready to deploy, run npm run build and you\u0026rsquo;ll get a clean Tailwind CSS build.\n🙋‍♀️ If you need help, feel free to ask a question on GitHub Discussions.\n","date":"8 August 2020","permalink":"/personal/docs/advanced-customisation/","section":"Documentation","summary":"There are many ways you can make advanced changes to Blowfish.

It may fail the first time and you\u0026rsquo;ll need to visit the Settings \u0026gt; Pages section of your GitHub repo to check the source is correct. It should be set to use the gh-pages branch.\nOnce the settings are configured, re-run the action and the site should build and deploy correctly. You can consult the actions log to check everything deployed successfully.\nNetlify\u003e Netlify # To deploy to Netlify, create a new continuous deployment site and link it to your source code. The build settings can be left blank in the Netlify UI. You will only need to configure the domain you\u0026rsquo;ll be using.\nThen in the root of your site repository, create a netlify.toml file:\n# netlify.toml [build] command = \u0026#34;hugo mod get -u \u0026amp;\u0026amp; hugo --gc --minify -b $URL\u0026#34; publish = \u0026#34;public\u0026#34; [build.environment] NODE_ENV = \u0026#34;production\u0026#34; GO_VERSION = \u0026#34;1.16\u0026#34; TZ = \u0026#34;UTC\u0026#34; # Set to preferred timezone [context.production.environment] HUGO_VERSION = \u0026#34;0.104.1\u0026#34; HUGO_ENV = \u0026#34;production\u0026#34; [context.deploy-preview.environment] HUGO_VERSION = \u0026#34;0.104.1\u0026#34; This configuration assumes you are deploying Blowfish as a Hugo module. If you have installed the theme using another method, change the build command to simply hugo --gc --minify -b $URL.\nWhen you push the config file to your repo, Netlify should automatically deploy your site. You can check the deploy logs in the Netlify UI to check for any errors.\nRender\u003e Render # Deploying to Render is very straightforward and all configuration is via the Render UI.\nCreate a new Static Site and link it to your project\u0026rsquo;s code repository. Then simply configure the build command to be hugo --gc --minify and publish directory to be public.\nThe site will automatically build and deploy whenever you push a change to your repo.\nCloudflare Pages\u003e Cloudflare Pages # Cloudflare offers the Pages service that can host Hugo blogs. It builds the site from a git repository and then hosts it on Cloudflare\u0026rsquo;s CDN. Follow their Hugo deployment guide to get started.\nThe Rocket Loader™ feature offered by Cloudflare tries to speed up rendering of web pages with JavaScript, but it breaks the appearance switcher in the theme. It can also cause an annoying light/dark screen flash when browsing your site due to scripts loading in the wrong order.\nThis problem can be fixed by disabling it:\nGo to the Cloudflare dashboard Click on your domain name in the list Click Optimization in the Speed section Scroll down to Rocket Loader™ and disable it Hugo sites built with Blowfish still load very quickly, even with this feature disabled.\nShared hosting, VPS or private web server\u003e Shared hosting, VPS or private web server # Using traditional web hosting, or deploying to your own web server, is as simple as building your Hugo site and transferring the files to your host.\nMake sure that the baseURL parameter in config.toml is set to the full URL to the root of your website (including any sub domains or sub-folders).\nThen build your site using hugo and copy the contents of the output directory to the root of your web server and you will be ready to go. By default, the output directory is named public.\nIf you need a hosting provider, check out Vultr or DigitalOcean. Signing up using these affiliate links will give you up to $100 in free credit so you can try the service.\n","date":"7 August 2020","permalink":"/personal/docs/hosting-deployment/","section":"Documentation","summary":"There are many ways to deploy your Hugo website built with Blowfish.

You can also view the page source on GitHub to see the markup.\nFlowchart\u003e Flowchart # graph TD A[Christmas] --\u003e|Get money| B(Go shopping) B --\u003e C{Let me think} B --\u003e G[/Another/] C ==\u003e|One| D[Laptop] C --\u003e|Two| E[iPhone] C --\u003e|Three| F[Car] subgraph Section C D E F G end Sequence diagram\u003e Sequence diagram # sequenceDiagram autonumber par Action 1 Alice-\u003e\u003eJohn: Hello John, how are you? and Action 2 Alice-\u003e\u003eBob: Hello Bob, how are you? end Alice-\u003e\u003e+John: Hello John, how are you?

Emoji can be used in titles, menu items and article content.\nNote: The rendering of these glyphs depends on the browser and the platform. To style the emoji you can either use a third party emoji font or a font stack. Emoji replacements are automatic throughout Blowfish, so you can use shorthand codes in your content and front matter and they will be converted to their corresponding symbols at build time.\nExample: see_no_evil 🙈, hear_no_evil 🙉, speak_no_evil 🙊.\nThe Emoji cheat sheet is a useful reference for emoji shorthand codes.\n","date":"5 March 2019","permalink":"/personal/samples/emoji/","section":"Content Samples","summary":"📖🏞️🧗🏽🐉🧙🏽‍♂️🧚🏽👸","title":"Emoji 🪂"}]
