Welcome to my personal site! 

My name is Vivian, and I am a senior at Harvard College studying Government and Statistics. I have a special interest in data science, and am excited to keep expanding my knowledge of data and social science. On this site, you'll find my favorite projects and studies I've done in my courses and freetime. Enjoy!
